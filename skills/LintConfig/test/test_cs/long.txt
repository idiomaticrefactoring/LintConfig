2 Source file basics2.1 File nameFor a source file containing classes, the file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class (of which there is exactly one), plus the .java extension.2.2 File encoding: UTF-8Source files are encoded in UTF-8.2.3 Special characters2.3.1 Whitespace charactersAside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that:All other whitespace characters are escaped in char and string literals and in text blocks.Tab characters are not used for indentation.2.3.2 Special escape sequencesFor any character that has a special escape sequence (\b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \s, \", \' and \\), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. \012) or Unicode (e.g. \u000a) escape.2.3.3 Non-ASCII charactersFor the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character (e.g. ∞) or the equivalent Unicode escape (e.g. \u221e) is used. The choice depends only on which makes the code easier to read and understand, although Unicode escapes outside string literals and comments are strongly discouraged.Tip: In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.Examples:Example	DiscussionString unitAbbrev = "μs";	Best: perfectly clear even without a comment.String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // "μs"	Allowed, but there's no reason to do this.String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // Greek letter mu, "s"	Allowed, but awkward and prone to mistakes.String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs";	Poor: the reader has no idea what this is.return '\ufeff' + content; // byte order mark	Good: use escapes for non-printable characters, and comment if necessary.Tip: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those programs are broken and they must be fixed.3 Source file structureAn ordinary source file consists of these sections, in order:License or copyright information, if presentPackage declarationImportsExactly one top-level class declarationExactly one blank line separates each section that is present.A package-info.java file is the same, but without the class declaration.A module-info.java file does not contain a package declaration and replaces the class declaration with a module declaration, but otherwise follows the same structure.3.1 License or copyright information, if presentIf license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.3.2 Package declarationThe package declaration is not line-wrapped. The column limit (Section 4.4, Column limit: 100) does not apply to package declarations.3.3 Imports3.3.1 No wildcard importsWildcard ("on-demand") imports, static or otherwise, are not used.3.3.2 No line-wrappingImports are not line-wrapped. The column limit (Section 4.4, Column limit: 100) does not apply to imports.3.3.3 Ordering and spacingImports are ordered as follows:All static imports in a single group.All non-static imports in a single group.If there are both static and non-static imports, a single blank line separates the two groups. There are no other blank lines between imports.Within each group the imported names appear in ASCII sort order. (Note: this is not the same as the import lines being in ASCII sort order, since '.' sorts before ';'.)3.3.4 No static import for classesStatic import is not used for static nested classes. They are imported with normal imports.3.4 Class declaration3.4.1 Exactly one top-level class declarationEach top-level class resides in a source file of its own.3.4.2 Ordering of class contentsThe order you choose for the members and initializers of your class can have a great effect on learnability. However, there's no single correct recipe for how to do it; different classes may order their contents in different ways.What is important is that each class uses some logical order, which its maintainer could explain if asked. For example, new methods are not just habitually added to the end of the class, as that would yield "chronological by date added" ordering, which is not a logical ordering.3.4.2.1 Overloads: never splitMethods of a class that share the same name appear in a single contiguous group with no other members in between. The same applies to multiple constructors. This rule applies even when modifiers such as static or private differ between the methods or constructors.3.5 Module declaration3.5.1 Ordering and spacing of module directivesModule directives are ordered as follows:All requires directives in a single block.All exports directives in a single block.All opens directives in a single block.All uses directives in a single block.All provides directives in a single block.A single blank line separates each block that is present.4 FormattingTerminology Note: block-like construct refers to the body of a class, method, constructor, or switch. Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers, any array initializer may optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.4.1 Braces4.1.1 Use of optional bracesBraces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.Other optional braces, such as those in a lambda expression, remain optional.4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K & R styleBraces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:No line break before the opening brace, except as detailed below.Line break after the opening brace.Line break before the closing brace.Line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma.Exception: In places where these rules allow a single statement ending with a semicolon (;), a block of statements can appear, and the opening brace of this block is preceded by a line break. Blocks like these are typically introduced to limit the scope of local variables.Examples:return () -> {  while (condition()) {    method();  }};return new MyClass() {  @Override public void method() {    if (condition()) {      try {        something();      } catch (ProblemException e) {        recover();      }    } else if (otherCondition()) {      somethingElse();    } else {      lastThing();    }    {      int x = foo();      frob(x);    }  }};A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1, Enum classes.4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be conciseAn empty block or block-like construct may be in K & R style (as described in Section 4.1.2). Alternatively, it may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between ({}), unless it is part of a multi-block statement (one that directly contains multiple blocks: if/else or try/catch/finally).Examples:  // This is acceptable  void doNothing() {}  // This is equally acceptable  void doNothingElse() {  }  // This is not acceptable: No concise empty blocks in a multi-block statement  try {    doSomething();  } catch (Exception e) {}4.2 Block indentation: +2 spacesEach time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2, Nonempty blocks: K & R Style.)4.3 One statement per lineEach statement is followed by a line break.4.4 Column limit: 100Java code has a column limit of 100 characters. A "character" means any Unicode code point. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in Section 4.5, Line-wrapping.Each Unicode code point counts as one character, even if its display width is greater or less. For example, if using fullwidth characters, you may choose to wrap the line earlier than where this rule strictly requires.Exceptions:Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in Javadoc, or a long JSNI method reference).package declarations and imports (see Sections 3.2 Package declarations and 3.3 Imports).Contents of text blocks.Command lines in a comment that may be copied-and-pasted into a shell.Very long identifiers, on the rare occasions they are called for, are allowed to exceed the column limit. In that case, the valid wrapping for the surrounding code is as produced by google-java-format.4.5 Line-wrappingTerminology Note: When code that might otherwise occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is called line-wrapping.There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing exactly how to line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.Note: While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit may be line-wrapped at the author's discretion.Tip: Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the need to line-wrap.4.5.1 Where to breakThe prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level. Also:When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript.)This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:the dot separator (.)the two colons of a method reference (::)an ampersand in a type bound (<T extends Foo & Bar>)a pipe in a catch block (catch (FooException | BarException e)).When a line is broken at an assignment operator the break typically comes after the symbol, but either way is acceptable.This also applies to the colon in an enhanced for ("foreach") statement.A method, constructor, or record-class name stays attached to the open parenthesis (() that follows it.A comma (,) stays attached to the token that precedes it.A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda or a switch rule, except that a break may come immediately after the arrow if the text following it consists of a single unbraced expression. Examples:MyLambda<String, Long, Object> lambda =    (String label, Long value, Object obj) -> {      ...    };Predicate<String> predicate = str ->    longExpressionInvolving(str);switch (x) {  case ColorPoint(Color color, Point(int x, int y)) ->      handleColorPoint(color, x, y);  ...}Note: The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, not necessarily code that fits in the smallest number of lines.4.5.2 Indent continuation lines at least +4 spacesWhen line-wrapping, each line after the first (each continuation line) is indented at least +4 from the original line.When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4 as desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.Section 4.6.3 on Horizontal alignment addresses the discouraged practice of using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with previous lines.4.6 Whitespace4.6.1 Vertical whitespace (blank lines)A single blank line always appears:Between consecutive members or initializers of a class: fields, constructors, methods, nested classes, static initializers, and instance initializers.Exception: A blank line between two consecutive fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to create logical groupings of fields.Exception: Blank lines between enum constants are covered in Section 4.8.1.As required by other sections of this document (such as Section 3, Source file structure, and Section 3.3, Imports).A single blank line may also appear anywhere it improves readability, for example between statements to organize the code into logical subsections. A blank line before the first member or initializer, or after the last member or initializer of the class, is neither encouraged nor discouraged.Multiple consecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).4.6.2 Horizontal whitespaceBeyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from within literals, comments and Javadoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following places only.Separating any keyword, such as if, for or catch, from an open parenthesis (() that follows it on that lineSeparating any keyword, such as else or catch, from a closing curly brace (}) that precedes it on that lineBefore any open curly brace ({), with two exceptions:@SomeAnnotation({a, b}) (no space is used)String[][] x = {{"foo"}}; (no space is required between {{, by item 10 below)On both sides of any binary or ternary operator. This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:the ampersand that separates multiple type bounds: <T extends Foo & Bar>the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions: catch (FooException | BarException e)the colon (:) in an enhanced for ("foreach") statementthe arrow in a lambda expression: (String str) -> str.length()or switch rule: case "FOO" -> bar();but notthe two colons (::) of a method reference, which is written like Object::toStringthe dot separator (.), which is written like object.toString()After ,:; or the closing parenthesis ()) of a castBetween any content and a double slash (//) which begins a comment. Multiple spaces are allowed.Between a double slash (//) which begins a comment and the comment's text. Multiple spaces are allowed.Between the type and identifier of a declaration: List<String> listOptional just inside both braces of an array initializernew int[] {5, 6} and new int[] { 5, 6 } are both validBetween a type annotation and [] or ....This rule is never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start or end of a line; it addresses only interior space.
