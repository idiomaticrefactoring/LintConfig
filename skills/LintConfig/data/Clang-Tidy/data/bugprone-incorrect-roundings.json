    "introduction": "Checks the usage of patterns known to produce incorrect rounding.\nProgrammers often use:\n\n(\nint\n)(\ndouble_expression\n \n+\n \n0.5\n)\n\nto round the double expression to an integer. The problem with this:\n\nIt is unnecessarily slow.\n\n\nIt is incorrect. The number 0.499999975 (smallest representable float\nnumber below 0.5) rounds to 1.0. Even worse behavior for negative\nnumbers where both -0.5f and -1.4f both round to 0.0.",
