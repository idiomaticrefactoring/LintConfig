    "introduction": "Warns when \nempty()\n is used on a range and the result is ignored. Suggests\n\nclear()\n if it is an existing member function.\n\nThe \nempty()\n method on several common ranges returns a Boolean indicating\nwhether or not the range is empty, but is often mistakenly interpreted as\na way to clear the contents of a range. Some ranges offer a \nclear()\n\nmethod for this purpose. This check warns when a call to empty returns a\nresult that is ignored, and suggests replacing it with a call to \nclear()\n\nif it is available as a member function of the range.\n\nFor example, the following code could be used to indicate whether a range\nis empty or not, but the result is ignored:\n\nstd\n::\nvector\n<\nint\n>\n \nv\n;\n\n\n...\n\n\nv\n.\nempty\n();\n\nA call to \nclear()\n would appropriately clear the contents of the range:\n\nstd\n::\nvector\n<\nint\n>\n \nv\n;\n\n\n...\n\n\nv\n.\nclear\n();\n\nLimitations\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\nDoesnât warn if \nempty()\n is defined and used with the ignore result in the\nclass template definition (for example in the library implementation). These\nerror cases can be caught with \n[[nodiscard]]\n attribute.",
