Testing frameworks make heavy use of this.\n\n\nIgnore types with trivial destructors. They are very unlikely to be RAII\nobjects and thereâs no difference when they are deleted.\n\n\nIgnore objects at the end of a compound statement (doesnât change behavior).\n\n\nIgnore objects returned from a call.",
