    "introduction": "Finds cases where code could use \ndata()\n rather than the address of the\nelement at index 0 in a container. This pattern is commonly used to materialize\na pointer to the backing data of a container. \nstd::vector\n and\n\nstd::string\n provide a \ndata()\n accessor to retrieve the data pointer\nwhich should be preferred.\n\nThis also ensures that in the case that the container is empty, the data\npointer access does not perform an errant memory access.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoredContainers\nÂ¶\n\n\nSemicolon-separated list of containers regexp for which this check wonât be\nenforced. Default is an empty string.",
