    "introduction": "Finds derived class methods that shadow a (non-virtual) base class method.\n\nIn order to be considered âshadowingâ, methods must have the same signature\n(i.e. the same name, same number of parameters, same parameter types, etc).\nOnly checks public, non-templated methods.\n\nThe below example is bugprone because consumers of the \nDerived\n class will\nexpect the \nreset\n method to do the work of \nBase::reset()\n in addition to\nextra work required to reset the \nDerived\n class.  Common fixes include:\n\nMaking the \nreset\n method polymorphic\n\n\nRe-naming \nDerived::reset\n if itâs not meant to intersect with\n\nBase::reset\n\n\nUsing \nusing\n \nBase::reset\n to change the access specifier\n\nThis is also a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.\n\nstruct\n \nBase\n \n{\n\n\n  \nvoid\n \nreset\n()\n \n{\n/* reset the base class */\n};\n\n\n};\n\n\n\nstruct\n \nDerived\n \n:\n \npublic\n \nBase\n \n{\n\n\n  \nvoid\n \nreset\n()\n \n{\n/* reset the derived class, but not the base class */\n};\n\n\n};",
