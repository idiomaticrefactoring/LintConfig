    "introduction": "cert-dcl16-c\n redirects here as an alias for this check.\nBy default, only the suffixes that begin with \nl\n (\nl\n, \nll\n, \nlu\n,\n\nllu\n, but not \nu\n, \nul\n, \null\n) are diagnosed by that alias.\n\nhicpp-uppercase-literal-suffix\n redirects here as an alias for this check.\n\nDetects when the integral literal or floating point (decimal or hexadecimal)\nliteral has a non-uppercase suffix and provides a fix-it hint with the\nuppercase suffix.\n\nAll valid combinations of suffixes are supported.\n\nauto\n \nx\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n  \n// OK, no suffix.\n\n\n\nauto\n \nx\n \n=\n \n1u\n;\n \n// warning: integer literal suffix 'u' is not upper-case\n\n\n\nauto\n \nx\n \n=\n \n1U\n;\n \n// OK, suffix is uppercase.\n\n\n\n...\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewSuffixes\nÂ¶\n\n\nOptionally, a list of the destination suffixes can be provided. When the\nsuffix is found, a case-insensitive lookup in that list is made, and if a\nreplacement is found that is different from the current suffix, then the\ndiagnostic is issued. This allows for fine-grained control of what suffixes to\nconsider and what their replacements should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nÂ¶\n\n\nGiven a list \nL;uL\n:\n\n\n\n\nl\n -> \nL\n\n\nL\n will be kept as is.\n\n\nul\n -> \nuL\n\n\nUl\n -> \nuL\n\n\nUL\n -> \nuL\n\n\nuL\n will be kept as is.\n\n\null\n will be kept as is, since it is not in the list\n\n\nand so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoreMacros\nÂ¶\n\n\nIf this option is set to \ntrue\n (default is \ntrue\n), the check will not warn\nabout literal suffixes inside macros.",
