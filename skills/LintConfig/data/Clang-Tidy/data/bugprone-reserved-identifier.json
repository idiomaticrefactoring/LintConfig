This mode is for use by e.g.\nstandard library implementors, to ensure they donât infringe on the user\nnamespace.\n\nThis check does not (yet) check for other reserved names, e.g. macro names\nidentical to language keywords, and names specifically reserved by language\nstandards, e.g. C++ âzombie namesâ and C future library directions.\n\nThis check corresponds to CERT C Coding Standard rule \nDCL37-C. Do not declare\nor define a reserved identifier\n\nas well as its C++ counterpart, \nDCL51-CPP. Do not declare or define a reserved\nidentifier\n.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvert\nÂ¶\n\n\nIf \ntrue\n, inverts the check, i.e. flags names that are not reserved.\nDefault is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowedIdentifiers\nÂ¶\n\n\nSemicolon-separated list of regular expressions that the check ignores. Default is an\nempty list.",
