    "introduction": "Finds macro expansions of \nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(Type)\n and replaces them\nwith a deleted copy constructor and a deleted assignment operator.\n\nBefore the \ndelete\n keyword was introduced in C++11 it was common practice to\ndeclare a copy constructor and an assignment operator as private members. This\neffectively makes them unusable to the public API of a class.\n\nWith the advent of the \ndelete\n keyword in C++11 we can abandon the\n\nprivate\n access of the copy constructor and the assignment operator and\ndelete the methods entirely.\n\nWhen running this check on a code like this:\n\nclass\n \nFoo\n \n{\n\n\nprivate\n:\n\n\n  \nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN\n(\nFoo\n);\n\n\n};\n\nIt will be transformed to this:\n\nclass\n \nFoo\n \n{\n\n\nprivate\n:\n\n\n  \nFoo\n(\nconst\n \nFoo\n \n&\n)\n \n=\n \ndelete\n;\n\n\n  \nconst\n \nFoo\n \n&\noperator\n=\n(\nconst\n \nFoo\n \n&\n)\n \n=\n \ndelete\n;\n\n\n};\n\nLimitations\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the migration example above leaves the \nprivate\n access\nspecification untouched. You might want to run the check\n\nmodernize-use-equals-delete\n\nto get warnings for deleted functions in private sections.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacroName\nÂ¶\n\n\nA string specifying the macro name whose expansion will be replaced.\nDefault is \nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN\n.\n\n\n\n\nSee: \nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function#Deleted_functions",
