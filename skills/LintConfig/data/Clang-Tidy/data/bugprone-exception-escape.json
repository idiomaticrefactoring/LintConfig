The functions which should not throw exceptions are the following:\n\nDestructors\n\n\nMove constructors\n\n\nMove assignment operators\n\n\nThe \nmain()\n functions\n\n\nswap()\n functions\n\n\niter_swap()\n functions\n\n\niter_move()\n functions\n\n\nFunctions marked with \nthrow()\n or \nnoexcept\n\n\nOther functions given as option\n\nA destructor throwing an exception may result in undefined behavior, resource\nleaks or unexpected termination of the program. Throwing move constructor or\nmove assignment also may result in undefined behavior or resource leak. The\n\nswap()\n operations expected to be non throwing most of the cases and they\nare always possible to implement in a non throwing way. Non throwing \nswap()\n\noperations are also used to create move operations. A throwing \nmain()\n\nfunction also results in unexpected termination.\n\nFunctions declared explicitly with \nnoexcept(false)\n or \nthrow(exception)\n\nwill be excluded from the analysis, as even though it is not recommended for\nfunctions like \nswap()\n, \nmain()\n, move constructors, move assignment\noperators and destructors, it is a clear indication of the developerâs\nintention and should be respected.\n\nWARNING! This check may be expensive on large source files.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckDestructors\nÂ¶\n\n\nWhen \ntrue\n, destructors are analyzed to not throw exceptions.\nDefault value is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckMoveMemberFunctions\nÂ¶\n\n\nWhen \ntrue\n, move constructors and move assignment operators are analyzed\nto not throw exceptions.
