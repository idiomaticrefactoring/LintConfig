    "introduction": "Analyzes OpenMP Structured Blocks and checks that no exception escapes\nout of the Structured Block it was thrown in.\n\nAs per the OpenMP specification, a structured block is an executable statement,\npossibly compound, with a single entry at the top and a single exit at the\nbottom. Which means, \nthrow\n may not be used to âexitâ out of the\nstructured block. If an exception is not caught in the same structured block\nit was thrown in, the behavior is undefined.\n\nFIXME: this check does not model SEH, \nsetjmp\n/\nlongjmp\n.\n\nWARNING! This check may be expensive on large source files.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoredExceptions\nÂ¶\n\n\nComma-separated list containing type names which are not counted as thrown\nexceptions in the check. Default value is an empty string.",
