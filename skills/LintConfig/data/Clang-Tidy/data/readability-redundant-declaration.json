Having redundant declarations could in worst\ncase mean that there are typos in the code that cause bugs.\n\nNormally the code can be automatically fixed, \nclang-tidy\n can remove\nthe second declaration. However there are 2 cases when you need to fix the code\nmanually:\n\nWhen the declarations are in different header files;\n\n\nWhen multiple variables are declared together.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoreMacros\nÂ¶\n\n\nIf set to \ntrue\n, the check will not give warnings inside macros.
