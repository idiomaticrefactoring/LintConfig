The check is case insensitive.\n\nSuch kernel file names cause the offline compiler to generate intermediate\ndesign files that have the same names as certain internal files, which\nleads to a compilation error.\n\nBased on the \nGuidelines for Naming the Kernel\n section in the\n\nIntel FPGA SDK for OpenCL Pro Edition: Programming Guide\n.",
