If a temporary object\nis created, but the objectâs type derives from (or is the same as) a class\nthat has âEXCEPTIONâ, âExceptionâ or âexceptionâ in its name, we can assume\nthat the programmerâs intention was to throw that object.\n\nExample:\n\nvoid\n \nf\n(\nint\n \ni\n)\n \n{\n\n\n  \nif\n \n(\ni\n \n<\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n\n    \n// Exception is created but is not thrown.\n\n\n    \nstd\n::\nruntime_error\n(\n\"Unexpected argument\"\n);\n\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}",
