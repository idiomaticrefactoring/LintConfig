    "introduction": "Finds obvious infinite loops (loops where the condition variable is not changed\nat all).\n\nFinding infinite loops is well-known to be impossible (halting problem).\nHowever, it is possible to detect some obvious infinite loops, for example, if\nthe loop condition is not changed. This check detects such loops. A loop is\nconsidered infinite if it does not have any loop exit statement (\nbreak\n,\n\ncontinue\n, \ngoto\n, \nreturn\n, \nthrow\n or a call to a function called as\n\n[[noreturn]]\n) and all of the following conditions hold for every variable\nin the condition:\n\nIt is a local variable.\n\n\nIt has no reference or pointer aliases.\n\n\nIt is not a structure or class member.\n\nFurthermore, the condition must not contain a function call to consider the\nloop infinite since functions may return different values for different calls.\n\nFor example, the following loop is considered infinite \ni\n is not changed in\nthe body:\n\nint\n \ni\n \n=\n \n0\n,\n \nj\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\nwhile\n \n(\ni\n \n<\n \n10\n)\n \n{\n\n\n  \n++\nj\n;\n\n\n}",
