    "introduction": "Finds function calls where the arguments passed are provided out of order,\nbased on the difference between the argument name and the parameter names\nof the function.\n\nGiven a function call \nf(foo,\n \nbar);\n and a function signature\n\nvoid\n \nf(T\n \ntvar,\n \nU\n \nuvar)\n, the arguments \nfoo\n and \nbar\n are swapped if\n\nfoo\n (the argument name) is more similar to \nuvar\n (the other parameter)\nthan \ntvar\n (the parameter it is currently passed to) \nand\n \nbar\n is\nmore similar to \ntvar\n than \nuvar\n.\n\nWarnings might indicate either that the arguments are swapped, or that the\nnamesâ cross-similarity might hinder code comprehension.\n\nHeuristics\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe following heuristics are implemented in the check.\nIf \nany\n of the enabled heuristics deem the arguments to be provided out of\norder, a warning will be issued.\n\n\nThe heuristics themselves are implemented by considering pairs of strings, and\nare symmetric, so in the following there is no distinction on which string is\nthe argument name and which string is the parameter name.\n\n\n\n\nEquality\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe most trivial heuristic, which compares the two strings for case-insensitive\nequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nÂ¶\n\n\nCommon abbreviations can be specified which will deem the strings similar if\nthe abbreviated and the abbreviation stand together.\nFor example, if \nsrc\n is registered as an abbreviation for \nsource\n, then\nthe following code example will be warned about.\n\n\nvoid\n \nfoo\n(\nint\n \nsource\n,\n \nint\n \nx\n);\n\n\n\nfoo\n(\nb\n,\n \nsrc\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abbreviations to recognise can be configured with the\n\nAbbreviations\n check option.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefix\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe \nprefix\n heuristic reports if one of the strings is a sufficiently long\nprefix of the other string, e.g. \ntarget\n to \ntargetPtr\n.\nThe similarity percentage is the length ratio of the prefix to the longer\nstring, in the previous example, it would be \n6 / 9 = 66.66â¦\n%.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n25\n% dissimilar and above \n30\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffix\nÂ¶\n\n\nAnalogous to the \nPrefix\n heuristic.\nIn the case of \noldValue\n and \nvalue\n compared, the similarity percentage\nis \n8 / 5 = 62.5\n%.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n25\n% dissimilar and above \n30\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstring\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe substring heuristic combines the prefix and the suffix heuristic, and tries\nto find the \nlongest common substring\n in the two strings provided.\nThe similarity percentage is the ratio of the found longest common substring\nagainst the \nlonger\n of the two input strings.\nFor example, given \nval\n and \nrvalue\n, the similarity is \n3 / 6 = 50\n%.\nIf no characters are common in the two string, \n0\n%.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n40\n% dissimilar and above \n50\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevenshtein distance (as \nLevenshtein\n)\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe \nLevenshtein distance\n\ndescribes how many single-character changes (additions, changes, or removals)\nmust be applied to transform one string into another.\n\n\nThe Levenshtein distance is translated into a similarity percentage by dividing\nit with the length of the \nlonger\n string, and taking its complement with\nregards to \n100\n%.\nFor example, given \nsomething\n and \nanything\n, the distance is \n4\n edits,\nand the similarity percentage is \n100\n% \n- 4 / 9 = 55.55â¦\n%.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n50\n% dissimilar and above \n66\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-sensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaroâWinkler distance (as \nJaroWinkler\n)\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe \nJaroâWinkler distance\n\nis an edit distance like the Levenshtein distance.\nIt is calculated from the amount of common characters that are sufficiently\nclose to each other in position, and to-be-changed characters.\nThe original definition of Jaro has been extended by Winkler to weigh prefix\nsimilarities more.\nThe similarity percentage is expressed as an average of the common and\nnon-common characters against the length of both strings.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n75\n% dissimilar and above \n85\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSÃ¸rensenâDice coefficient (as \nDice\n)\nÂ¶\n\n\nThe \nSÃ¸rensenâDice coefficient\n\nwas originally defined to measure the similarity of two sets.\nFormally, the coefficient is calculated by dividing \n2 * #(intersection)\n with\n\n#(set1) + #(set2)\n, where \n#()\n is the cardinality function of sets.\nThis metric is applied to strings by creating bigrams (substring sequences of\nlength 2) of the two strings and using the set of bigrams for the two strings\nas the two sets.\n\n\nThis heuristic can be configured with \nbounds\n.\nThe default bounds are: below \n60\n% dissimilar and above \n70\n% similar.\nThis heuristic is case-insensitive.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimumIdentifierNameLength\nÂ¶\n\n\nSets the minimum required length the argument and parameter names\nneed to have. Names shorter than this length will be ignored.\nDefaults to \n3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations\nÂ¶\n\n\nFor the \nAbbreviation\n heuristic\n(\nsee here\n), this option configures the\nabbreviations in the \nâabbreviation=abbreviated_valueâ\n format.\nThe option is a string, with each value joined by \nâ;â\n.\n\n\nBy default, the following abbreviations are set:\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddr=address\n\n\narr=array\n\n\nattr=attribute\n\n\nbuf=buffer\n\n\ncl=client\n\n\ncnt=count\n\n\ncol=column\n\n\ncpy=copy\n\n\ndest=destination\n\n\ndist=distance\n\n\ndst=distance\n\n\nelem=element\n\n\nhght=height\n\n\ni=index\n\n\nidx=index\n\n\nlen=length\n\n\nln=line\n\n\nlst=list\n\n\nnr=number\n\n\nnum=number\n\n\npos=position\n\n\nptr=pointer\n\n\nref=reference\n\n\nsrc=source\n\n\nsrv=server\n\n\nstmt=statement\n\n\nstr=string\n\n\nval=value\n\n\nvar=variable\n\n\nvec=vector\n\n\nwdth=width\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration options for each implemented heuristic (see above) is\nconstructed dynamically.\nIn the following, \n<HeuristicName>\n refers to one of the keys from the\nheuristics implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<HeuristicName>\nÂ¶\n\n\nTrue\n or \nFalse\n, whether a particular heuristic, such as \nEquality\n or\n\nLevenshtein\n is enabled.\n\n\nDefaults to \nTrue\n for every heuristic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<HeuristicName>DissimilarBelow\n,\n \n<HeuristicName>SimilarAbove\nÂ¶\n\n\nA value between \n0\n and \n100\n, expressing a percentage.\nThe bounds set what percentage of similarity the heuristic must deduce\nfor the two identifiers to be considered similar or dissimilar by the\ncheck.\n\n\nGiven arguments \narg1\n and \narg2\n passed to \nparam1\n and \nparam2\n,\nrespectively, the bounds check is performed in the following way:\nIf the similarity of the currently passed argument order\n(\narg1\n to \nparam1\n) is \nbelow\n the \nDissimilarBelow\n threshold, and\nthe similarity of the suggested swapped order (\narg1\n to \nparam2\n) is\n\nabove\n the \nSimilarAbove\n threshold, the swap is reported.\n\n\nFor the defaults of each heuristic, \nsee above\n.\n\nName synthesis\nÂ¶\n\n\nWhen comparing the argument names and parameter names, the following logic is\nused to gather the names for comparison:\n\n\nParameter names are the identifiers as written in the source code.\n\n\nArgument names are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a variable is passed, the variableâs name.\n\n\nIf a subsequent function callâs return value is used as argument, the\ncalled functionâs name.\n\n\nOtherwise, empty string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty argument or parameter names are ignored by the heuristics.",
