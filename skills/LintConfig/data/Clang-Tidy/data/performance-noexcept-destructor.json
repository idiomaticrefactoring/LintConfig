    "introduction": "The check flags user-defined destructors marked with \nnoexcept(expr)\n\nwhere \nexpr\n evaluates to \nfalse\n (but is not a \nfalse\n literal itself).\n\nWhen a destructor is marked as \nnoexcept\n, it assures the compiler that\nno exceptions will be thrown during the destruction of an object, which\nallows the compiler to perform certain optimizations such as omitting\nexception handling code.",
