    "introduction": "This check flags all use of C-style casts that perform a \nstatic_cast\n\ndowncast, \nconst_cast\n, or \nreinterpret_cast\n.\n\nUse of these casts can violate type safety and cause the program to access a\nvariable that is actually of type X to be accessed as if it were of an\nunrelated type Z. Note that a C-style \n(T)expression\n cast means to perform\nthe first of the following that is possible: a \nconst_cast\n, a\n\nstatic_cast\n, a \nstatic_cast\n followed by a \nconst_cast\n, a\n\nreinterpret_cast\n, or a \nreinterpret_cast\n followed by a \nconst_cast\n.\nThis rule bans \n(T)expression\n only when used to perform an unsafe cast.\n\nThis rule is part of the \nType safety (Type.4)\n\nprofile from the C++ Core Guidelines.",
