    "introduction": "Finds \nassert()\n with side effect.\n\nThe condition of \nassert()\n is evaluated only in debug builds so a\ncondition with side effect can cause different behavior in debug / release\nbuilds.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssertMacros\nÂ¶\n\n\nA comma-separated list of the names of assert macros to be checked.\nDefault is \nassert,NSAssert,NSCAssert\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckFunctionCalls\nÂ¶\n\n\nWhether to treat non-const member and non-member functions as they produce\nside effects. Disabled by default because it can increase the number of false\npositive warnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoredFunctions\nÂ¶\n\n\nA semicolon-separated list of the names of functions or methods to be\nconsidered as not having side-effects. Regular expressions are accepted,\ne.g. \n[Rr]ef(erence)?$\n matches every type with suffix \nRef\n, \nref\n,\n\nReference\n and \nreference\n. The default is empty. If a name in the list\ncontains the sequence \n::\n it is matched against the qualified type name\n(i.e. \nnamespace::Type\n), otherwise it is matched against only\nthe type name (i.e. \nType\n).",
