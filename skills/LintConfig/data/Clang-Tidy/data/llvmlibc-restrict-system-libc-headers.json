For example consider a system libc\nwhose \ndirent\n struct has slightly different field ordering than llvm-libc.\nWhile this will compile successfully, this can cause issues during runtime\nbecause they are ABI incompatible.\n\nOptions\nÂ¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes\nÂ¶\n\n\nA string containing a comma separated glob list of allowed include\nfilenames. Similar to the -checks glob list for running clang-tidy itself,\nthe two wildcard characters are \n*\n and \n-\n, to include and exclude globs,\nrespectively. The default is \n-*\n, which disallows all includes.\n\n\nThis can be used to allow known safe includes such as Linux development\nheaders.
