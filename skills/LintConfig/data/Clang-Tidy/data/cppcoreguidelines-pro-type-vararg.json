    "introduction": "This check flags all calls to c-style vararg functions and all use of\n\nva_arg\n.\n\nTo allow for SFINAE use of vararg functions, a call is not flagged if a literal\n0 is passed as the only vararg argument or function is used in unevaluated\ncontext.\n\nPassing to varargs assumes the correct type will be read. This is fragile\nbecause it cannot generally be enforced to be safe in the language and so\nrelies on programmer discipline to get it right.\n\nThis rule is part of the \nType safety (Type.8)\n\nprofile from the C++ Core Guidelines.",
