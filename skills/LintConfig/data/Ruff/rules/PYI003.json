  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unrecognized-version-info-check] [Message: Unrecognized <code>sys.version_info</code> check] What it does Checks for problematic sys.version_info-related conditions in stubs. Why is this bad? Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python versions using sys.version_info. However, there are a number of common mistakes involving sys.version_info comparisons that should be avoided. For example, comparing against a string can lead to unexpected behavior. Example import sys if sys.version_info[0] == \"2\": ... Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info[0] == 2: ...",
