  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blank-line-between-methods] [Message: Expected {BLANK_LINES_NESTED_LEVEL:?} blank line, found 0] What it does Checks for missing blank lines between methods of a class. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends exactly one blank line between methods of a class. Example class MyClass(object): def func1(): pass def func2(): pass Use instead: class MyClass(object): def func1(): pass def func2(): pass Typing stub files (.pyi) The typing style guide recommends to not use blank lines between methods except to group them. That's why this rule is not enabled in typing stub files.",
