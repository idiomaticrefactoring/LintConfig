  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: non-pep695-generic-function] [Message: Generic function <code>{name}</code> should use type parameters] What it does Checks for use of standalone type variables and parameter specifications in generic functions. Why is this bad? Special type parameter syntax was introduced in Python 3.12 by PEP 695 for defining generic functions. This syntax is easier to read and provides cleaner support for generics. Known problems The rule currently skips generic functions nested inside of other functions or classes and those with type parameters containing the default argument introduced in PEP 696 and implemented in Python 3.13. Not all type checkers fully support PEP 695 yet, so even valid fixes suggested by this rule may cause type checking to fail. Fix safety This fix is marked unsafe, as PEP 695 uses inferred variance for type parameters, instead of the covariant and contravariant keywords used by TypeVar variables. As such, replacing a TypeVar variable with an inline type parameter may change its variance. Additionally, if the rule cannot determine whether a parameter annotation corresponds to a type variable (e.g. for a type imported from another module), it will not add the type to the generic type parameter list. This causes the function to have a mix of old-style type variables and new-style generic type parameters, which will be rejected by type checkers. Example from typing import TypeVar T = TypeVar(\"T\") def generic_function(var: T) -> T: return var Use instead: def generic_function[T](var: T) -> T: return var See also This rule replaces standalone type variables in function signatures but doesn't remove the corresponding type variables even if they are unused after the fix. See unused-private-type-var for a rule to clean up unused private type variables. This rule will not rename private type variables to remove leading underscores, even though the new type parameters are restricted in scope to their associated function. See private-type-parameter for a rule to update these names. This rule only applies to generic functions and does not include generic classes. See non-pep695-generic-class for the class version.",

      "option_description": "The minimum Python version to target, e.g., when considering automatic\ncode upgrades, like rewriting type annotations. Ruff will not propose\nchanges using features that are not available in the given version.\n\nFor example, to represent supporting Python >=3.11 or ==3.11\nspecify target-version = \"py311\".\n\nIf you're already using a pyproject.toml file, we recommend\nproject.requires-python instead, as it's based on Python packaging\nstandards, and will be respected by other tools. For example, Ruff\ntreats the following as identical to target-version = \"py38\":\n\n[project]\nrequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\nIf both are specified, target-version takes precedence over\nrequires-python. See Inferring the Python version\nfor a complete description of how the target-version is determined\nwhen left unspecified.\n\nNote that a stub file can sometimes make use of a typing feature\nbefore it is available at runtime, as long as the stub does not make\nuse of new syntax. For example, a type checker will understand\nint | str in a stub as being a Union type annotation, even if the\ntype checker is run using Python 3.9, despite the fact that the |\noperator can only be used to create union types at runtime on Python\n3.10+. As such, Ruff will often recommend newer features in a stub\nfile than it would for an equivalent runtime file with the same target\nversion.\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\npyproject.tomlruff.toml\n\n\n[tool.ruff]\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"\n\n\n\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"",
