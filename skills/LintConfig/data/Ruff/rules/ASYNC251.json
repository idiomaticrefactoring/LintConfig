  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: blocking-sleep-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not call <code>time.sleep</code>] What it does Checks that async functions do not call time.sleep. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a time.sleep call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the time.sleep, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of time.sleep, use asyncio.sleep. Example import time async def fetch(): time.sleep(1) Use instead: import asyncio async def fetch(): await asyncio.sleep(1)",
