  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: camelcase-imported-as-constant] [Message: Camelcase <code>{name}</code> imported as constant <code>{asname}</code>] What it does Checks for CamelCase imports that are aliased to constant-style names. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends naming conventions for classes, functions, constants, and more. The use of inconsistent naming styles between import and alias names may lead readers to expect an import to be of another type (e.g., confuse a Python class with a constant). Import aliases should thus follow the same naming style as the member being imported. Example from example import MyClassName as MY_CLASS_NAME Use instead: from example import MyClassName Note Identifiers consisting of a single uppercase character are ambiguous under the rules of PEP 8, which specifies CamelCase for classes and ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants. Without a second character, it is not possible to reliably guess whether the identifier is intended to be part of a CamelCase string for a class or an ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE string for a constant, since both conventions will produce the same output when given a single input character. Therefore, this lint rule does not apply to cases where the alias for the imported identifier consists of a single uppercase character. A common example of a single uppercase character being used for a class name can be found in Django's django.db.models.Q class.",
