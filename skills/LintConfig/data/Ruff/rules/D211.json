  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: blank-line-before-class] [Message: No blank lines allowed before class docstring] What it does Checks for docstrings on class definitions that are preceded by a blank line. Why is this bad? Avoid introducing any blank lines between a class definition and its docstring, for consistency. This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the google, numpy, and pep257 conventions. For an alternative, see D203. Example class PhotoMetadata: \"\"\"Metadata about a photo.\"\"\" Use instead: class PhotoMetadata: \"\"\"Metadata about a photo.\"\"\"",
