        "description": "Description\n\nA list of file patterns to exclude from formatting and linting.\n\nExclusions are based on globs, and can be either:\n\n- Single-path patterns, like `.mypy_cache` (to exclude any directory\n  named `.mypy_cache` in the tree), `foo.py` (to exclude any file named\n  `foo.py`), or `foo_*.py` (to exclude any file matching `foo_*.py` ).\n- Relative patterns, like `directory/foo.py` (to exclude that specific\n  file) or `directory/*.py` (to exclude any Python files in\n  `directory`). Note that these paths are relative to the project root\n  (e.g., the directory containing your `pyproject.toml`).\n\nFor more information on the glob syntax, refer to the [`globset` documentation](https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax).\n\nNote that you'll typically want to use\n[`extend-exclude`](#extend-exclude) to modify the excluded paths.",
