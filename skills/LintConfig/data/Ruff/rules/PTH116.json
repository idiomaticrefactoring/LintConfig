  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-stat] [Message: <code>os.stat()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.stat()</code>, <code>Path.owner()</code>, or <code>Path.group()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.stat. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.stat() can improve readability over the os module's counterparts (e.g., os.path.stat()). Examples import os from pwd import getpwuid from grp import getgrgid stat = os.stat(file_name) owner_name = getpwuid(stat.st_uid).pw_name group_name = getgrgid(stat.st_gid).gr_name Use instead: from pathlib import Path file_path = Path(file_name) stat = file_path.stat() owner_name = file_path.owner() group_name = file_path.group() Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
