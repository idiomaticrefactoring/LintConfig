  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: wait-for-process-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not wait on processes with blocking methods] What it does Checks that async functions do not wait on processes with blocking methods. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library or function, like trio.to_thread.run_sync() or anyio.to_thread.run_sync(). Example import os async def foo(): os.waitpid(0) Use instead: import asyncio import os def wait_for_process(): os.waitpid(0) async def foo(): await asyncio.loop.run_in_executor(None, wait_for_process)",
