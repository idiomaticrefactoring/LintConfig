  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-all-object] [Message: Invalid object in <code>__all__</code>, must contain only strings] What it does Checks for the inclusion of invalid objects in __all__. Why is this bad? In Python, __all__ should contain a sequence of strings that represent the names of all \"public\" symbols exported by a module. Assigning anything other than a tuple or list of strings to __all__ is invalid. Example __all__ = [Foo, 1, None] Use instead: __all__ = [\"Foo\", \"Bar\", \"Baz\"]",
