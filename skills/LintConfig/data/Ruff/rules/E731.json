  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: lambda-assignment] [Message: Do not assign a <code>lambda</code> expression, use a <code>def</code>] What it does Checks for lambda expressions which are assigned to a variable. Why is this bad? Per PEP 8, you should \"Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.\" Using a def statement leads to better tracebacks, and the assignment itself negates the primary benefit of using a lambda expression (i.e., that it can be embedded inside another expression). Example f = lambda x: 2 * x Use instead: def f(x): return 2 * x",
