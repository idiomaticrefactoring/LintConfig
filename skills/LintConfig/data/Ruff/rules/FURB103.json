  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: write-whole-file] [Message: <code>Path.open()</code> followed by <code>write()</code> can be replaced by <code>{filename}.{suggestion}</code>] What it does Checks for uses of open and write that can be replaced by pathlib methods, like Path.write_text and Path.write_bytes. Why is this bad? When writing a single string to a file, it's simpler and more concise to use pathlib methods like Path.write_text and Path.write_bytes instead of open and write calls via with statements. Example with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as f: f.write(\"some text\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(\"file.txt\").write_text(\"some text\") Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.",
