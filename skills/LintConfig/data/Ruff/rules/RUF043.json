  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-raises-ambiguous-pattern] [Message: Pattern passed to <code>match=</code> contains metacharacters but is neither escaped nor raw] What it does Checks for non-raw literal string arguments passed to the match parameter of pytest.raises() where the string contains at least one unescaped regex metacharacter. Why is this bad? The match argument is implicitly converted to a regex under the hood. It should be made explicit whether the string is meant to be a regex or a \"plain\" pattern by prefixing the string with the r suffix, escaping the metacharacter(s) in the string using backslashes, or wrapping the entire string in a call to re.escape(). Example import pytest with pytest.raises(Exception, match=\"A full sentence.\"): do_thing_that_raises() If the pattern is intended to be a regular expression, use a raw string to signal this intention: import pytest with pytest.raises(Exception, match=r\"A full sentence.\"): do_thing_that_raises() Alternatively, escape any regex metacharacters with re.escape: import pytest import re with pytest.raises(Exception, match=re.escape(\"A full sentence.\")): do_thing_that_raises() or directly with backslashes: import pytest import re with pytest.raises(Exception, \"A full sentence\\\\.\"): do_thing_that_raises()",
