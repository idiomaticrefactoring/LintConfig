  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: timeout-error-alias] [Message: Replace aliased errors with <code>TimeoutError</code>] What it does Checks for uses of exceptions that alias TimeoutError. Why is this bad? TimeoutError is the builtin error type used for exceptions when a system function timed out at the system level. In Python 3.10, socket.timeout was aliased to TimeoutError. In Python 3.11, asyncio.TimeoutError was aliased to TimeoutError. These aliases remain in place for compatibility with older versions of Python, but may be removed in future versions. Prefer using TimeoutError directly, as it is more idiomatic and future-proof. Example import asyncio raise asyncio.TimeoutError Use instead: raise TimeoutError Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if it would delete any comments within the exception expression range.",
