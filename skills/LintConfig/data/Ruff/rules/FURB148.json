  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: unnecessary-enumerate] [Message: <code>enumerate</code> value is unused, use <code>for x in range(len(y))</code> instead] What it does Checks for uses of enumerate that discard either the index or the value when iterating over a sequence. Why is this bad? The built-in enumerate function is useful when you need both the index and value of a sequence. If you only need the index or values of a sequence, you should iterate over range(len(...)) or the sequence itself, respectively, instead. This is more efficient and communicates the intent of the code more clearly. Known problems This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations; namely, it will only suggest a fix using the len builtin function if the sequence passed to enumerate is an instantiated as a list, set, dict, or tuple literal, or annotated as such with a type annotation. The len builtin function is not defined for all object types (such as generators), and so refactoring to use len over enumerate is not always safe. Example for index, _ in enumerate(sequence): print(index) for _, value in enumerate(sequence): print(value) Use instead: for index in range(len(sequence)): print(index) for value in sequence: print(value)",
