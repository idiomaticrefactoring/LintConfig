  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: too-many-boolean-expressions] [Message: Too many Boolean expressions ({expressions} > {max_expressions})] What it does Checks for too many Boolean expressions in an if statement. By default, this rule allows up to 5 expressions. This can be configured using the lint.pylint.max-bool-expr option. Why is this bad? if statements with many Boolean expressions are harder to understand and maintain. Consider assigning the result of the Boolean expression, or any of its sub-expressions, to a variable. Example if a and b and c and d and e and f and g and h: ...",
