  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: non-capitalized-section-name] [Message: Section name should be properly capitalized (\"{name}\")] What it does Checks for section headers in docstrings that do not begin with capital letters. Why is this bad? For stylistic consistency, all section headers in a docstring should be capitalized. Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections. Each section typically has a header and a body. This rule is enabled when using the numpy and google conventions, and disabled when using the pep257 convention. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. returns: Speed as distance divided by time. raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
