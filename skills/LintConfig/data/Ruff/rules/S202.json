Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., /etc/passwd), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., ../etc/passwd). On Python 3.12 and later, use filter='data' to prevent the most dangerous security issues (see: PEP 706). On earlier versions, set the members argument to a trusted subset of the archive's members. Example import tarfile import tempfile tar = tarfile.open(filename) tar.extractall(path=tempfile.mkdtemp()) tar.close()",
