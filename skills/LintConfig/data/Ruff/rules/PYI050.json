  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: no-return-argument-annotation-in-stub] [Message: Prefer <code>{module}.Never</code> over <code>NoReturn</code> for argument annotations] What it does Checks for uses of typing.NoReturn (and typing_extensions.NoReturn) for parameter annotations. Why is this bad? Prefer Never over NoReturn for parameter annotations. Never has a clearer name in these contexts, since it makes little sense to talk about a parameter annotation \"not returning\". This is a purely stylistic lint: the two types have identical semantics for type checkers. Both represent Python's \"bottom type\" (a type that has no members). Example from typing import NoReturn def foo(x: NoReturn): ... Use instead: from typing import Never def foo(x: Never): ...",
