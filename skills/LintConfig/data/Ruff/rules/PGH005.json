  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-mock-access] [Message: Mock method should be called: <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for common mistakes when using mock objects. Why is this bad? The mock module exposes an assertion API that can be used to verify that mock objects undergo expected interactions. This rule checks for common mistakes when using this API. For example, it checks for mock attribute accesses that should be replaced with mock method calls. Example my_mock.assert_called Use instead: my_mock.assert_called()",
