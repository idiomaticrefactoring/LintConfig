  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unary-prefix-increment-decrement] [Message: Python does not support the unary prefix increment operator (<code>++</code>)] What it does Checks for the attempted use of the unary prefix increment (++) or decrement operator (--). Why is this bad? Python does not support the unary prefix increment or decrement operator. Writing ++n is equivalent to +(+(n)) and writing --n is equivalent to -(-(n)). In both cases, it is equivalent to n. Example ++x --y Use instead: x += 1 y -= 1",
