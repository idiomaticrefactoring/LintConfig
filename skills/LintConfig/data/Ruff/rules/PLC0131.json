  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: type-bivariance] [Message: <code>{kind}</code> cannot be both covariant and contravariant] What it does Checks for TypeVar and ParamSpec definitions in which the type is both covariant and contravariant. Why is this bad? By default, Python's generic types are invariant, but can be marked as either covariant or contravariant via the covariant and contravariant keyword arguments. While the API does allow you to mark a type as both covariant and contravariant, this is not supported by the type system, and should be avoided. Instead, change the variance of the type to be either covariant, contravariant, or invariant. If you want to describe both covariance and contravariance, consider using two separate type parameters. For context: an \"invariant\" generic type only accepts values that exactly match the type parameter; for example, list[Dog] accepts only list[Dog], not list[Animal] (superclass) or list[Bulldog] (subclass). This is the default behavior for Python's generic types. A \"covariant\" generic type accepts subclasses of the type parameter; for example, Sequence[Animal] accepts Sequence[Dog]. A \"contravariant\" generic type accepts superclasses of the type parameter; for example, Callable[Dog] accepts Callable[Animal]. Example from typing import TypeVar T = TypeVar(\"T\", covariant=True, contravariant=True) Use instead: from typing import TypeVar T_co = TypeVar(\"T_co\", covariant=True) T_contra = TypeVar(\"T_contra\", contravariant=True)",
