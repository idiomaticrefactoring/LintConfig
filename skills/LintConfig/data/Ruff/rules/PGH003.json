  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: blanket-type-ignore] [Message: Use specific rule codes when ignoring type issues] What it does Check for type: ignore annotations that suppress all type warnings, as opposed to targeting specific type warnings. Why is this bad? Suppressing all warnings can hide issues in the code. Blanket type: ignore annotations are also more difficult to interpret and maintain, as the annotation does not clarify which warnings are intended to be suppressed.
