  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-ftp-lib-usage] [Message: FTP-related functions are being called. FTP is considered insecure. Use SSH/SFTP/SCP or some other encrypted protocol.] What it does Checks for the use of FTP-related functions. Why is this bad? FTP is considered insecure as it does not encrypt data sent over the connection and is thus vulnerable to numerous attacks. Instead, consider using FTPS (which secures FTP using SSL/TLS) or SFTP. In preview, this rule will also flag references to FTP-related functions.",
