  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: missing-whitespace-around-modulo-operator] [Message: Missing whitespace around modulo operator] What it does Checks for missing whitespace around the modulo operator. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends never using more than one space, and always having the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator. For consistency, this rule enforces one space before and after a modulo operator (%). (Note that PEP 8 suggests only adding whitespace around the operator with the lowest precedence, but that authors should \"use [their] own judgment\".) Example remainder = 10%2 Use instead: remainder = 10 % 2",
