  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-literal-within-dict-call] [Message: Unnecessary dict {kind} passed to <code>dict()</code> (remove the outer call to <code>dict()</code>)] What it does Checks for dict() calls that take unnecessary dict literals or dict comprehensions as arguments. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to wrap a dict literal or comprehension within a dict() call, since the literal or comprehension syntax already returns a dictionary. Example dict({}) dict({\"a\": 1}) Use instead: {} {\"a\": 1} Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
