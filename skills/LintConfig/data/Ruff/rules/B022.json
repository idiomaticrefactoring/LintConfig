  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-contextlib-suppress] [Message: No arguments passed to <code>contextlib.suppress</code>. No exceptions will be suppressed and therefore this context manager is redundant] What it does Checks for contextlib.suppress without arguments. Why is this bad? contextlib.suppress is a context manager that suppresses exceptions. It takes, as arguments, the exceptions to suppress within the enclosed block. If no exceptions are specified, then the context manager won't suppress any exceptions, and is thus redundant. Consider adding exceptions to the contextlib.suppress call, or removing the context manager entirely. Example import contextlib with contextlib.suppress(): foo() Use instead: import contextlib with contextlib.suppress(Exception): foo()",
  "option": {}
