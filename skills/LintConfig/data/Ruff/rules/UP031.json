  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: printf-string-formatting] [Message: Use format specifiers instead of percent format] What it does Checks for printf-style string formatting, and offers to replace it with str.format calls. Why is this bad? printf-style string formatting has a number of quirks, and leads to less readable code than using str.format calls or f-strings. In general, prefer the newer str.format and f-strings constructs over printf-style string formatting. Example \"%s, %s\" % (\"Hello\", \"World\") # \"Hello, World\" Use instead: \"{}, {}\".format(\"Hello\", \"World\") # \"Hello, World\" f\"{'Hello'}, {'World'}\" # \"Hello, World\" Fix safety In cases where the format string contains a single generic format specifier (e.g. %s), and the right-hand side is an ambiguous expression, we cannot offer a safe fix. For example, given: \"%s\" % val val could be a single-element tuple, or a single value (not contained in a tuple). Both of these would resolve to the same formatted string when using printf-style formatting, but resolve differently when using f-strings: val = 1 print(\"%s\" % val) # \"1\" print(\"{}\".format(val)) # \"1\" val = (1,) print(\"%s\" % val) # \"1\" print(\"{}\".format(val)) # \"(1,)\"",
