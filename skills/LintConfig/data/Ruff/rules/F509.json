  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: percent-format-unsupported-format-character] [Message: <code>%</code>-format string has unsupported format character <code>{char}</code>] What it does Checks for printf-style format strings with invalid format characters. Why is this bad? In printf-style format strings, the % character is used to indicate placeholders. If a % character is not followed by a valid format character, it will raise a ValueError at runtime. Example \"Hello, %S\" % \"world\" Use instead: \"Hello, %s\" % \"world\"",
