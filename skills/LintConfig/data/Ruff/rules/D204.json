  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: incorrect-blank-line-after-class] [Message: 1 blank line required after class docstring] What it does Checks for class methods that are not separated from the class's docstring by a blank line. Why is this bad? PEP 257 recommends the use of a blank line to separate a class's docstring from its methods. This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the numpy and pep257 conventions, and disabled when using the google convention. Example class PhotoMetadata: \"\"\"Metadata about a photo.\"\"\" def __init__(self, file: Path): ... Use instead: class PhotoMetadata: \"\"\"Metadata about a photo.\"\"\" def __init__(self, file: Path): ...",
