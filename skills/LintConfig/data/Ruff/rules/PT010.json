  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-raises-without-exception] [Message: Set the expected exception in <code>pytest.raises()</code>] What it does Checks for pytest.raises calls without an expected exception. Why is this bad? pytest.raises expects to receive an expected exception as its first argument. If omitted, the pytest.raises call will fail at runtime. The rule will also accept calls without an expected exception but with match and/or check keyword arguments, which are also valid after pytest version 8.4.0. Example import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.raises(): do_something() Use instead: import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.raises(SomeException): do_something()",
