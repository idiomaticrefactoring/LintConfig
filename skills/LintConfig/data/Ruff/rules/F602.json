  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: multi-value-repeated-key-variable] [Message: Dictionary key <code>{name}</code> repeated] What it does Checks for dictionary keys that are repeated with different values. Why is this bad? Dictionary keys should be unique. If a key is repeated with a different value, the first values will be overwritten and the key will correspond to the last value. This is likely a mistake. Example foo = { bar: 1, baz: 2, baz: 3, } foo[baz] # 3 Use instead: foo = { bar: 1, baz: 2, } foo[baz] # 2 Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing a repeated dictionary key may delete comments that are attached to the removed key-value pair. This can also change the program's behavior if the value expressions have side effects.",
