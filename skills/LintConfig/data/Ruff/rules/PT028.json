  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-parameter-with-default-argument] [Message: Test function parameter <code>{}</code> has default argument] What it does Checks for parameters of test functions with default arguments. Why is this bad? Such a parameter will always have the default value during the test regardless of whether a fixture with the same name is defined. Example def test_foo(a=1): ... Use instead: def test_foo(a): ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as modifying a function signature can change the behavior of the code.",
