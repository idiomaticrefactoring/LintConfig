  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: read-whole-file] [Message: <code>Path.open()</code> followed by <code>read()</code> can be replaced by <code>{filename}.{suggestion}</code>] What it does Checks for uses of open and read that can be replaced by pathlib methods, like Path.read_text and Path.read_bytes. Why is this bad? When reading the entire contents of a file into a variable, it's simpler and more concise to use pathlib methods like Path.read_text and Path.read_bytes instead of open and read calls via with statements. Example with open(\"file.txt\") as f: contents = f.read() Use instead: from pathlib import Path contents = Path(\"file.txt\").read_text() Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.",
