  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-exception-statement] [Message: Missing <code>raise</code> statement on exception] What it does Checks for an exception that is not raised. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to create an exception without raising it. For example, ValueError(\"...\") on its own will have no effect (unlike raise ValueError(\"...\")) and is likely a mistake. Known problems This rule only detects built-in exceptions, like ValueError, and does not catch user-defined exceptions. In preview, this rule will also detect user-defined exceptions, but only the ones defined in the file being checked. Example ValueError(\"...\") Use instead: raise ValueError(\"...\") Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting a useless exception statement to a raise statement will change the program's behavior.",
