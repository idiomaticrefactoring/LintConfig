  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: doc-line-too-long] [Message: Doc line too long ({width} > {limit})] What it does Checks for doc lines that exceed the specified maximum character length. Why is this bad? For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments), overlong lines can hurt readability. PEP 8, for example, recommends that such lines be limited to 72 characters, while this rule enforces the limit specified by the lint.pycodestyle.max-doc-length setting. (If no value is provided, this rule will be ignored, even if it's added to your --select list.) In the context of this rule, a \"doc line\" is defined as a line consisting of either a standalone comment or a standalone string, like a docstring. In the interest of pragmatism, this rule makes a few exceptions when determining whether a line is overlong. Namely, it: Ignores lines that consist of a single \"word\" (i.e., without any whitespace between its characters). Ignores lines that end with a URL, as long as the URL starts before the line-length threshold. Ignores line that end with a pragma comment (e.g., # type: ignore or # noqa), as long as the pragma comment starts before the line-length threshold. That is, a line will not be flagged as overlong if a pragma comment causes it to exceed the line length. (This behavior aligns with that of the Ruff formatter.) If lint.pycodestyle.ignore-overlong-task-comments is true, this rule will also ignore comments that start with any of the specified lint.task-tags (e.g., # TODO:). Example def function(x): \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis auctor purus ut ex fermentum, at maximus est hendrerit.\"\"\" Use instead: def function(x): \"\"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis auctor purus ut ex fermentum, at maximus est hendrerit. \"\"\" Error suppression Hint: when suppressing W505 errors within multi-line strings (like docstrings), the noqa directive should come at the end of the string (after the closing triple quote), and will apply to the entire string, like so: \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor. \"\"\" # noqa: W505",
