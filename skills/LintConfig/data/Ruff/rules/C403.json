  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-list-comprehension-set] [Message: Unnecessary list comprehension (rewrite as a set comprehension)] What it does Checks for unnecessary list comprehensions. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to use a list comprehension inside a call to set(), since there is an equivalent comprehension for this type. Example set([f(x) for x in foo]) Use instead: {f(x) for x in foo} Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
