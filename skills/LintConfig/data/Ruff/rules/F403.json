  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undefined-local-with-import-star] [Message: <code>from {name} import *</code> used; unable to detect undefined names] What it does Checks for the use of wildcard imports. Why is this bad? Wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *) make it hard to determine which symbols are available in the current namespace, and from which module they were imported. They're also discouraged by PEP 8. Example from math import * def area(radius): return pi * radius**2 Use instead: from math import pi def area(radius): return pi * radius**2",
