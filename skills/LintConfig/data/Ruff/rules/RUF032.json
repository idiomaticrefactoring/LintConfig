  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: decimal-from-float-literal] [Message: <code>Decimal()</code> called with float literal argument] What it does Checks for Decimal calls passing a float literal. Why is this bad? Float literals have limited precision that can lead to unexpected results. The Decimal class is designed to handle numbers with fixed-point precision, so a string literal should be used instead. Example num = Decimal(1.2345) Use instead: num = Decimal(\"1.2345\") Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because it changes the underlying value of the Decimal instance that is constructed. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your program relies on the previous value (whether deliberately or not).",
