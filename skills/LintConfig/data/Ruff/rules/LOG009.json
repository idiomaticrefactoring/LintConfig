  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undocumented-warn] [Message: Use of undocumented <code>logging.WARN</code> constant] What it does Checks for uses of logging.WARN. Why is this bad? The logging.WARN constant is an undocumented alias for logging.WARNING. Although it’s not explicitly deprecated, logging.WARN is not mentioned in the logging documentation. Prefer logging.WARNING instead. Example import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN) Use instead: import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)",
