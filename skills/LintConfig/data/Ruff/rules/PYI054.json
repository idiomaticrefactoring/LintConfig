  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: numeric-literal-too-long] [Message: Numeric literals with a string representation longer than ten characters are not permitted] What it does Checks for numeric literals with a string representation longer than ten characters. Why is this bad? If a function has a default value where the literal representation is greater than 10 characters, the value is likely to be an implementation detail or a constant that varies depending on the system you're running on. Default values like these should generally be omitted from stubs. Use ellipses (...) instead. Example def foo(arg: int = 693568516352839939918568862861217771399698285293568) -> None: ... Use instead: def foo(arg: int = ...) -> None: ...",
