  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: shebang-leading-whitespace] [Message: Avoid whitespace before shebang] What it does Checks for whitespace before a shebang directive. Why is this bad? In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. The shebang's #! prefix must be the first two characters of a file. The presence of whitespace before the shebang will cause the shebang to be ignored, which is likely a mistake. Example #!/usr/bin/env python3 Use instead: #!/usr/bin/env python3",
