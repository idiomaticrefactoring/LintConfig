  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: exc-info-outside-except-handler] [Message: <code>exc_info=</code> outside exception handlers] What it does Checks for logging calls with exc_info= outside exception handlers. Why is this bad? Using exc_info=True outside of an exception handler attaches None as the exception information, leading to confusing messages: >>> logging.warning(\"Uh oh\", exc_info=True) WARNING:root:Uh oh NoneType: None Example import logging logging.warning(\"Foobar\", exc_info=True) Use instead: import logging logging.warning(\"Foobar\") Fix safety The fix is always marked as unsafe, as it changes runtime behavior.",
