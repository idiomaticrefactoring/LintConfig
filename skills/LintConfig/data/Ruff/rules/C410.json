  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-literal-within-list-call] [Message: Unnecessary list literal passed to <code>list()</code> (remove the outer call to <code>list()</code>)] What it does Checks for list() calls that take unnecessary list or tuple literals as arguments. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a list() call, since there is a literal syntax for these types. If a list literal is passed in, then the outer call to list() should be removed. Otherwise, if a tuple literal is passed in, then it should be rewritten as a list literal. Example list([1, 2]) list((1, 2)) Use instead: [1, 2] [1, 2] Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
