  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: if-else-block-instead-of-if-exp] [Message: Use ternary operator <code>{contents}</code> instead of <code>if</code>-<code>else</code>-block] What it does Check for if-else-blocks that can be replaced with a ternary or binary operator. The lint is suppressed if the suggested replacement would exceed the maximum line length configured in pycodestyle.max-line-length. Why is this bad? if-else-blocks that assign a value to a variable in both branches can be expressed more concisely by using a ternary or binary operator. Example if foo: bar = x else: bar = y Use instead: bar = x if foo else y Or: if cond: z = cond else: z = other_cond Use instead: z = cond or other_cond Known issues This is an opinionated style rule that may not always be to everyone's taste, especially for code that makes use of complex if conditions. Ternary operators can also make it harder to measure code coverage with tools that use line profiling.",
