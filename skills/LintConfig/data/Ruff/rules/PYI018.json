  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unused-private-type-var] [Message: Private {type_var_like_kind} <code>{type_var_like_name}</code> is never used] What it does Checks for the presence of unused private TypeVar, ParamSpec or TypeVarTuple declarations. Why is this bad? A private TypeVar that is defined but not used is likely a mistake. It should either be used, made public, or removed to avoid confusion. A type variable is considered \"private\" if its name starts with an underscore. Example import typing import typing_extensions _T = typing.TypeVar(\"_T\") _Ts = typing_extensions.TypeVarTuple(\"_Ts\") Fix safety The fix is always marked as unsafe, as it would break your code if the type variable is imported by another module.",
