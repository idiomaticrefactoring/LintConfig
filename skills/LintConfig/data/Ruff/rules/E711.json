  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: none-comparison] [Message: Comparison to <code>None</code> should be <code>cond is None</code>] What it does Checks for comparisons to None which are not using the is operator. Why is this bad? According to PEP 8, \"Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not, never the equality operators.\" Example if arg != None: pass if None == arg: pass Use instead: if arg is not None: pass Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may alter runtime behavior when used with libraries that override the ==/__eq__ or !=/__ne__ operators. In these cases, is/is not may not be equivalent to ==/!=. For more information, see this issue.",
