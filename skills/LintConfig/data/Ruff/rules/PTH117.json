  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-path-isabs] [Message: <code>os.path.isabs()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.is_absolute()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.path.isabs. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os.path. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.is_absolute() can improve readability over the os.path module's counterparts (e.g., as os.path.isabs()). Examples import os if os.path.isabs(file_name): print(\"Absolute path!\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path if Path(file_name).is_absolute(): print(\"Absolute path!\") Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
