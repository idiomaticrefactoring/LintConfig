  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: hashlib-digest-hex] [Message: Use of hashlib's <code>.digest().hex()</code>] What it does Checks for the use of .digest().hex() on a hashlib hash, like sha512. Why is this bad? When generating a hex digest from a hash, it's preferable to use the .hexdigest() method, rather than calling .digest() and then .hex(), as the former is more concise and readable. Example from hashlib import sha512 hashed = sha512(b\"some data\").digest().hex() Use instead: from hashlib import sha512 hashed = sha512(b\"some data\").hexdigest() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.",
