  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: hardcoded-password-default] [Message: Possible hardcoded password assigned to function default: \"{}\"] What it does Checks for potential uses of hardcoded passwords in function argument defaults. Why is this bad? Including a hardcoded password in source code is a security risk, as an attacker could discover the password and use it to gain unauthorized access. Instead, store passwords and other secrets in configuration files, environment variables, or other sources that are excluded from version control. Example def connect_to_server(password=\"hunter2\"): ... Use instead: import os def connect_to_server(password=os.environ[\"PASSWORD\"]): ...",
  "option": {}
