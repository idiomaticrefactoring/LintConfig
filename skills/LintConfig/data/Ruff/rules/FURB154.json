  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: repeated-global] [Message: Use of repeated consecutive <code>{}</code>] What it does Checks for consecutive global (or nonlocal) statements. Why is this bad? The global and nonlocal keywords accepts multiple comma-separated names. Instead of using multiple global (or nonlocal) statements for separate variables, you can use a single statement to declare multiple variables at once. Example def func(): global x global y print(x, y) Use instead: def func(): global x, y print(x, y) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the statements contain comments.",
