  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: docstring-missing-returns] [Message: <code>return</code> is not documented in docstring] What it does Checks for functions with return statements that do not have \"Returns\" sections in their docstrings. Why is this bad? A missing \"Returns\" section is a sign of incomplete documentation. This rule is not enforced for abstract methods or functions that only return None. It is also ignored for \"stub functions\": functions where the body only consists of pass, ..., raise NotImplementedError, or similar. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. \"\"\" return distance / time Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. \"\"\" return distance / time",
