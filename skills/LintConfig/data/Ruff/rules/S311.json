  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-non-cryptographic-random-usage] [Message: Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for cryptographic purposes] What it does Checks for uses of cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generators. Why is this bad? Cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generators are insecure, as they are easily predictable. This can allow an attacker to guess the generated numbers and compromise the security of the system. Instead, use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (such as using the secrets module) when generating random numbers for security purposes. In preview, this rule will also flag references to these generators. Example import random random.randrange(10) Use instead: import secrets secrets.randbelow(10)",
