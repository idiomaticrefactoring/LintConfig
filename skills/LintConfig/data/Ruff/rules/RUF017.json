  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: quadratic-list-summation] [Message: Avoid quadratic list summation] What it does Checks for the use of sum() to flatten lists of lists, which has quadratic complexity. Why is this bad? The use of sum() to flatten lists of lists is quadratic in the number of lists, as sum() creates a new list for each element in the summation. Instead, consider using another method of flattening lists to avoid quadratic complexity. The following methods are all linear in the number of lists: functools.reduce(operator.iadd, lists, []) list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(lists)) [item for sublist in lists for item in sublist] When fixing relevant violations, Ruff defaults to the functools.reduce form, which outperforms the other methods in microbenchmarks. Example lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] joined = sum(lists, []) Use instead: import functools import operator lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] functools.reduce(operator.iadd, lists, []) Fix safety This fix is always marked as unsafe because sum uses the __add__ magic method while operator.iadd uses the __iadd__ magic method, and these behave differently on lists. The former requires the right summand to be a list, whereas the latter allows for any iterable. Therefore, the fix could inadvertently cause code that previously raised an error to silently succeed. Moreover, the fix could remove comments from the original code.",
