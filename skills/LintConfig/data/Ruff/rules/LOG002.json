  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-get-logger-argument] [Message: Use <code>__name__</code> with <code>logging.getLogger()</code>] What it does Checks for any usage of __cached__ and __file__ as an argument to logging.getLogger(). Why is this bad? The logging documentation recommends this pattern: logging.getLogger(__name__) Here, __name__ is the fully qualified module name, such as foo.bar, which is the intended format for logger names. This rule detects probably-mistaken usage of similar module-level dunder constants: __cached__ - the pathname of the module's compiled version, such as foo/__pycache__/bar.cpython-311.pyc. __file__ - the pathname of the module, such as foo/bar.py. Example import logging logger = logging.getLogger(__file__) Use instead: import logging logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) Fix safety This fix is always unsafe, as changing the arguments to getLogger can change the received logger object, and thus program behavior.",
