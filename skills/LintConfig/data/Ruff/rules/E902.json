  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: io-error] [Message: {message}] What it does This is not a regular diagnostic; instead, it's raised when a file cannot be read from disk. Why is this bad? An IOError indicates an error in the development setup. For example, the user may not have permissions to read a given file, or the filesystem may contain a broken symlink. Example On Linux or macOS: $ echo 'print(\"hello world!\")' > a.py $ chmod 000 a.py $ ruff a.py a.py:1:1: E902 Permission denied (os error 13) Found 1 error.",
