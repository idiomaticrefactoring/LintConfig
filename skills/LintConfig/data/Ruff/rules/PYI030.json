  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-literal-union] [Message: Multiple literal members in a union. Use a single literal, e.g. <code>Literal[{}]</code>] What it does Checks for the presence of multiple literal types in a union. Why is this bad? Literal[\"foo\", 42] has identical semantics to Literal[\"foo\"] | Literal[42], but is clearer and more concise. Example from typing import Literal field: Literal[1] | Literal[2] | str Use instead: from typing import Literal field: Literal[1, 2] | str Fix safety This fix is marked unsafe if it would delete any comments within the replacement range. An example to illustrate where comments are preserved and where they are not: from typing import Literal field: ( # deleted comment Literal[\"a\", \"b\"] # deleted comment # deleted comment | Literal[\"c\", \"d\"] # preserved comment )",
