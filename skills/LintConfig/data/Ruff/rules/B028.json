  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: no-explicit-stacklevel] [Message: No explicit <code>stacklevel</code> keyword argument found] What it does Checks for warnings.warn calls without an explicit stacklevel keyword argument. Why is this bad? The warnings.warn method uses a stacklevel of 1 by default, which will output a stack frame of the line on which the \"warn\" method is called. Setting it to a higher number will output a stack frame from higher up the stack. It's recommended to use a stacklevel of 2 or higher, to give the caller more context about the warning. Example import warnings warnings.warn(\"This is a warning\") Use instead: import warnings warnings.warn(\"This is a warning\", stacklevel=2) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because it changes the behavior of the code. Moreover, the fix will assign a stacklevel of 2, while the user may wish to assign a higher stacklevel to address the diagnostic.",
