  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: docstring-extraneous-parameter] [Message: Documented parameter <code>{id}</code> is not in the function's signature] What it does Checks for function docstrings that include parameters which are not in the function signature. Why is this bad? If a docstring documents a parameter which is not in the function signature, it can be misleading to users and/or a sign of incomplete documentation or refactors. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. acceleration: Rate of change of speed. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. \"\"\" return distance / time Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. \"\"\" return distance / time",
