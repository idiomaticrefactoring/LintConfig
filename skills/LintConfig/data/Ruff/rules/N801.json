  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-class-name] [Message: Class name <code>{name}</code> should use CapWords convention] What it does Checks for class names that do not follow the CamelCase convention. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends the use of the CapWords (or CamelCase) convention for class names: Class names should normally use the CapWords convention. The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable. Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants. Example class my_class: pass Use instead: class MyClass: pass",
