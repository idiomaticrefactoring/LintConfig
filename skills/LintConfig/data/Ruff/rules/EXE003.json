  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: shebang-missing-python] [Message: Shebang should contain <code>python</code>, <code>pytest</code>, or <code>uv run</code>] What it does Checks for a shebang directive in .py files that does not contain python, pytest, or uv run. Why is this bad? In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a script, which specifies the command that should be used to run the script. For Python scripts, if the shebang does not include a command that explicitly or implicitly specifies an interpreter, then the file will be executed with the default interpreter, which is likely a mistake. Example #!/usr/bin/env bash Use instead: #!/usr/bin/env python3",
