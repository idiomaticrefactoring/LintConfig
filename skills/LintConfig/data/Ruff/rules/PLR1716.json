  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: boolean-chained-comparison] [Message: Contains chained boolean comparison that can be simplified] What it does Check for chained boolean operations that can be simplified. Why is this bad? Refactoring the code will improve readability for these cases. Example a = int(input()) b = int(input()) c = int(input()) if a < b and b < c: pass Use instead: a = int(input()) b = int(input()) c = int(input()) if a < b < c: pass",
