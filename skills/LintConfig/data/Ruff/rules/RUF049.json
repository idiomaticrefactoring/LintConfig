  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: dataclass-enum] [Message: An enum class should not be decorated with <code>@dataclass</code>] What it does Checks for enum classes which are also decorated with @dataclass. Why is this bad? Decorating an enum with @dataclass() does not cause any errors at runtime, but may cause erroneous results: @dataclass class E(Enum): A = 1 B = 2 print(E.A == E.B) # True Example from dataclasses import dataclass from enum import Enum @dataclass class E(Enum): ... Use instead: from enum import Enum class E(Enum): ...",
