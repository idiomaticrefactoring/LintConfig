  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: p-print] [Message: <code>pprint</code> found] What it does Checks for pprint statements. Why is this bad? Like print statements, pprint statements used for debugging should be omitted from production code. They can lead the accidental inclusion of sensitive information in logs, and are not configurable by clients, unlike logging statements. pprint statements used to produce output as a part of a command-line interface program are not typically a problem. Example import pprint def merge_dicts(dict_a, dict_b): dict_c = {**dict_a, **dict_b} pprint.pprint(dict_c) return dict_c Use instead: def merge_dicts(dict_a, dict_b): dict_c = {**dict_a, **dict_b} return dict_c Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it will remove pprint statements that are used beyond debugging purposes.",
