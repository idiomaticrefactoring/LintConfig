  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blank-lines-after-function-or-class] [Message: Expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found ({blank_lines})] What it does Checks for missing blank lines after the end of function or class. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends using blank lines as follows: Two blank lines are expected between functions and classes One blank line is expected between methods of a class. Example class User(object): pass user = User() Use instead: class User(object): pass user = User() Typing stub files (.pyi) The typing style guide recommends to not use blank lines between statements except to group them. That's why this rule is not enabled in typing stub files.",
