  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: byte-string-usage] [Message: Do not use <code>{origin}.ByteString</code>, which has unclear semantics and is deprecated] What it does Checks for uses of typing.ByteString or collections.abc.ByteString. Why is this bad? ByteString has been deprecated since Python 3.9 and will be removed in Python 3.17. The Python documentation recommends using either collections.abc.Buffer (or the typing_extensions backport on Python \\<3.12) or a union like bytes | bytearray | memoryview instead. Example from typing import ByteString Use instead: from collections.abc import Buffer",
