  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: slice-copy] [Message: Prefer <code>copy</code> method over slicing] What it does Checks for unbounded slice expressions to copy a list. Why is this bad? The list.copy method is more readable and consistent with copying other types. Known problems This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations, as it will only detect lists that are instantiated as literals or annotated with a type annotation. Example a = [1, 2, 3] b = a[:] Use instead: a = [1, 2, 3] b = a.copy() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the slice expression contains comments.",
