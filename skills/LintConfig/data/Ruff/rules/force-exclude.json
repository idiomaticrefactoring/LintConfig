Setting `force-exclude = true` will cause Ruff to\nrespect these exclusions unequivocally.\n\nThis is useful for [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/), which explicitly passes all\nchanged files to the [`ruff-pre-commit`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit)\nplugin, regardless of whether they're marked as excluded by Ruff's own\nsettings.",
