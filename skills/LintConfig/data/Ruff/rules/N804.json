  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-first-argument-name-for-class-method] [Message: First argument of a class method should be named <code>cls</code>] What it does Checks for class methods that use a name other than cls for their first argument. The method __new__ is exempted from this check and the corresponding violation is caught by bad-staticmethod-argument. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends the use of cls as the first argument for all class methods: Always use cls for the first argument to class methods. If a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.) Names can be excluded from this rule using the lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names or lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names configuration options. For example, to allow the use of klass as the first argument to class methods, set the lint.pep8-naming.extend-ignore-names option to [\"klass\"]. Example class Example: @classmethod def function(self, data): ... Use instead: class Example: @classmethod def function(cls, data): ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as renaming a method parameter can change the behavior of the program.",
