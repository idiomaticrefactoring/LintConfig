Why is this bad? Unused positional arguments are redundant, and often indicative of a mistake. They should be removed. Example \"Hello, {0}\".format(\"world\", \"!\") Use instead: \"Hello, {0}\".format(\"world\") Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the unused positional argument contains a function call with potential side effects, because removing such arguments could change the behavior of the code. For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case: \"Hello, {0}\".format(\"world\", print(1))",
