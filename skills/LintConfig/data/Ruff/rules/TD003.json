  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-todo-link] [Message: Missing issue link for this TODO] What it does Checks that a TODO comment is associated with a link to a relevant issue or ticket. Why is this bad? Including an issue link near a TODO makes it easier for resolvers to get context around the issue. Example # TODO: this link has no issue Use one of these instead: # TODO(charlie): this comment has an issue link # https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3870 # TODO(charlie): this comment has a 3-digit issue code # 003 # TODO(charlie): https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3870 # this comment has an issue link # TODO(charlie): #003 this comment has a 3-digit issue code # with leading character `#` # TODO(charlie): this comment has an issue code (matches the regex `[A-Z]+\\-?\\d+`) # SIXCHR-003",
