  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: import-outside-top-level] [Message: <code>import</code> should be at the top-level of a file] What it does Checks for import statements outside of a module's top-level scope, such as within a function or class definition. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends placing imports not only at the top-level of a module, but at the very top of the file, \"just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.\" import statements have effects that are global in scope; defining them at the top level has a number of benefits. For example, it makes it easier to identify the dependencies of a module, and ensures that any invalid imports are caught regardless of whether a specific function is called or class is instantiated. An import statement would typically be placed within a function only to avoid a circular dependency, to defer a costly module load, or to avoid loading a dependency altogether in a certain runtime environment. Example def print_python_version(): import platform print(platform.python_version()) Use instead: import platform def print_python_version(): print(platform.python_version()) See also This rule will ignore import statements configured in lint.flake8-tidy-imports.banned-module-level-imports if the rule banned-module-level-imports is enabled.",
