  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: loop-variable-overrides-iterator] [Message: Loop control variable <code>{name}</code> overrides iterable it iterates] What it does Checks for loop control variables that override the loop iterable. Why is this bad? Loop control variables should not override the loop iterable, as this can lead to confusing behavior. Instead, use a distinct variable name for any loop control variables. Example items = [1, 2, 3] for items in items: print(items) Use instead: items = [1, 2, 3] for item in items: print(item)",
