  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: true-false-comparison] [Message: Avoid equality comparisons to <code>True</code>; use <code>{cond}:</code> for truth checks] What it does Checks for equality comparisons to boolean literals. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends against using the equality operators == and != to compare values to True or False. Instead, use if cond: or if not cond: to check for truth values. If you intend to check if a value is the boolean literal True or False, consider using is or is not to check for identity instead. Example if foo == True: ... if bar == False: ... Use instead: if foo: ... if not bar: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may alter runtime behavior when used with libraries that override the ==/__eq__ or !=/__ne__ operators. In these cases, is/is not may not be equivalent to ==/!=. For more information, see this issue.",
