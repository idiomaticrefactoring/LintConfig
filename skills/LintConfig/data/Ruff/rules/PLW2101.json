  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-with-lock] [Message: Threading lock directly created in <code>with</code> statement has no effect] What it does Checks for lock objects that are created and immediately discarded in with statements. Why is this bad? Creating a lock (via threading.Lock or similar) in a with statement has no effect, as locks are only relevant when shared between threads. Instead, assign the lock to a variable outside the with statement, and share that variable between threads. Example import threading counter = 0 def increment(): global counter with threading.Lock(): counter += 1 Use instead: import threading counter = 0 lock = threading.Lock() def increment(): global counter with lock: counter += 1",
