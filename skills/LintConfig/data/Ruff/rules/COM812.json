  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-trailing-comma] [Message: Trailing comma missing] What it does Checks for the absence of trailing commas. Why is this bad? The presence of a trailing comma can reduce diff size when parameters or elements are added or removed from function calls, function definitions, literals, etc. Example foo = { \"bar\": 1, \"baz\": 2 } Use instead: foo = { \"bar\": 1, \"baz\": 2, } Formatter compatibility We recommend against using this rule alongside the formatter. The formatter enforces consistent use of trailing commas, making the rule redundant.",
