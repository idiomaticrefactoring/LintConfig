  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: future-required-type-annotation] [Message: Missing <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>, but uses {reason}] What it does Checks for uses of PEP 585- and PEP 604-style type annotations in Python modules that lack the required from __future__ import annotations import for compatibility with older Python versions. Why is this bad? Using PEP 585 and PEP 604 style annotations without a from __future__ import annotations import will cause runtime errors on Python versions prior to 3.9 and 3.10, respectively. By adding the __future__ import, the interpreter will no longer interpret annotations at evaluation time, making the code compatible with both past and future Python versions. This rule respects the target-version setting. For example, if your project targets Python 3.10 and above, adding from __future__ import annotations does not impact your ability to leverage PEP 604-style unions (e.g., to convert Optional[str] to str | None). As such, this rule will only flag such usages if your project targets Python 3.9 or below. Example def func(obj: dict[str, int | None]) -> None: ... Use instead: from __future__ import annotations def func(obj: dict[str, int | None]) -> None: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as adding from __future__ import annotations may change the semantics of the program.",

      "option_description": "The minimum Python version to target, e.g., when considering automatic\ncode upgrades, like rewriting type annotations. Ruff will not propose\nchanges using features that are not available in the given version.\n\nFor example, to represent supporting Python >=3.11 or ==3.11\nspecify target-version = \"py311\".\n\nIf you're already using a pyproject.toml file, we recommend\nproject.requires-python instead, as it's based on Python packaging\nstandards, and will be respected by other tools. For example, Ruff\ntreats the following as identical to target-version = \"py38\":\n\n[project]\nrequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\nIf both are specified, target-version takes precedence over\nrequires-python. See Inferring the Python version\nfor a complete description of how the target-version is determined\nwhen left unspecified.\n\nNote that a stub file can sometimes make use of a typing feature\nbefore it is available at runtime, as long as the stub does not make\nuse of new syntax. For example, a type checker will understand\nint | str in a stub as being a Union type annotation, even if the\ntype checker is run using Python 3.9, despite the fact that the |\noperator can only be used to create union types at runtime on Python\n3.10+. As such, Ruff will often recommend newer features in a stub\nfile than it would for an equivalent runtime file with the same target\nversion.\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\npyproject.tomlruff.toml\n\n\n[tool.ruff]\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"\n\n\n\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"",
