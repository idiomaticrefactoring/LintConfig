  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-at] [Message: Use <code>.loc</code> instead of <code>.at</code>. If speed is important, use NumPy.] What it does Checks for uses of .at on Pandas objects. Why is this bad? The .at method selects a single value from a DataFrame or Series based on a label index, and is slightly faster than using .loc. However, .loc is more idiomatic and versatile, as it can be used to select multiple values at once. If performance is an important consideration, convert the object to a NumPy array, which will provide a much greater performance boost than using .at over .loc. Example import pandas as pd students_df = pd.read_csv(\"students.csv\") students_df.at[\"Maria\"] Use instead: import pandas as pd students_df = pd.read_csv(\"students.csv\") students_df.loc[\"Maria\"]",
