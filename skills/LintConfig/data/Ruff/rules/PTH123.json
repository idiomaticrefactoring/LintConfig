  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: builtin-open] [Message: <code>open()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.open()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of the open() builtin. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.open() can improve readability over the open builtin. Examples with open(\"f1.py\", \"wb\") as fp: ... Use instead: from pathlib import Path with Path(\"f1.py\").open(\"wb\") as fp: ... Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than working directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python. Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.",
