  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-literal-member] [Message: Duplicate literal member <code>{}</code>] What it does Checks for duplicate members in a typing.Literal[] slice. Why is this bad? Duplicate literal members are redundant and should be removed. Example from typing import Literal foo: Literal[\"a\", \"b\", \"a\"] Use instead: from typing import Literal foo: Literal[\"a\", \"b\"] Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments. Note that while the fix may flatten nested literals into a single top-level literal, the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.",
