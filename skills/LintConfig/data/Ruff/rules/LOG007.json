  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: exception-without-exc-info] [Message: Use of <code>logging.exception</code> with falsy <code>exc_info</code>] What it does Checks for uses of logging.exception() with exc_info set to False. Why is this bad? The logging.exception() method captures the exception automatically, but accepts an optional exc_info argument to override this behavior. Setting exc_info to False disables the automatic capture of the exception and stack trace. Instead of setting exc_info to False, prefer logging.error(), which has equivalent behavior to logging.exception() with exc_info set to False, but is clearer in intent. Example logging.exception(\"...\", exc_info=False) Use instead: logging.error(\"...\")",
