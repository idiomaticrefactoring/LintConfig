  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: weak-cryptographic-key] [Message: {cryptographic_key} key sizes below {minimum_key_size} bits are considered breakable] What it does Checks for uses of cryptographic keys with vulnerable key sizes. Why is this bad? Small keys are easily breakable. For DSA and RSA, keys should be at least 2048 bits long. For EC, keys should be at least 224 bits long. Example from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa, ec dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=512) ec.generate_private_key(curve=ec.SECT163K1()) Use instead: from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import dsa, ec dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=4096) ec.generate_private_key(curve=ec.SECP384R1())",
