  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-isinstance-call] [Message: Multiple <code>isinstance</code> calls for <code>{name}</code>, merge into a single call] What it does Checks for multiple isinstance calls on the same target. Why is this bad? To check if an object is an instance of any one of multiple types or classes, it is unnecessary to use multiple isinstance calls, as the second argument of the isinstance built-in function accepts a tuple of types and classes. Using a single isinstance call implements the same behavior with more concise code and clearer intent. Example if isinstance(obj, int) or isinstance(obj, float): pass Use instead: if isinstance(obj, (int, float)): pass",
  "option": {}
