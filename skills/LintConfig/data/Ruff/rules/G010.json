  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: logging-warn] [Message: Logging statement uses <code>warn</code> instead of <code>warning</code>] What it does Checks for uses of logging.warn and logging.Logger.warn. Why is this bad? logging.warn and logging.Logger.warn are deprecated in favor of logging.warning and logging.Logger.warning, which are functionally equivalent. Known problems This rule detects uses of the logging module via a heuristic. Specifically, it matches against: Uses of the logging module itself (e.g., import logging; logging.info(...)). Uses of flask.current_app.logger (e.g., from flask import current_app; current_app.logger.info(...)). Objects whose name starts with log or ends with logger or logging, when used in the same file in which they are defined (e.g., logger = logging.getLogger(); logger.info(...)). Imported objects marked as loggers via the lint.logger-objects setting, which can be used to enforce these rules against shared logger objects (e.g., from module import logger; logger.info(...), when lint.logger-objects is set to [\"module.logger\"]). Example import logging logging.warn(\"Something happened\") Use instead: import logging logging.warning(\"Something happened\")",
