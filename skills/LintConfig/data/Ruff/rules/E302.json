  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blank-lines-top-level] [Message: Expected {expected_blank_lines:?} blank lines, found {actual_blank_lines}] What it does Checks for missing blank lines between top level functions and classes. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends exactly two blank lines between top level functions and classes. The rule respects the lint.isort.lines-after-imports setting when determining the required number of blank lines between top-level import statements and function or class definitions for compatibility with isort. Example def func1(): pass def func2(): pass Use instead: def func1(): pass def func2(): pass Typing stub files (.pyi) The typing style guide recommends to not use blank lines between classes and functions except to group them. That's why this rule is not enabled in typing stub files.",
