  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: super-call-with-parameters] [Message: Use <code>super()</code> instead of <code>super(__class__, self)</code>] What it does Checks for super calls that pass redundant arguments. Why is this bad? In Python 3, super can be invoked without any arguments when: (1) the first argument is __class__, and (2) the second argument is equivalent to the first argument of the enclosing method. When possible, omit the arguments to super to make the code more concise and maintainable. Example class A: def foo(self): pass class B(A): def bar(self): super(B, self).foo() Use instead: class A: def foo(self): pass class B(A): def bar(self): super().foo() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing the arguments from a call may delete comments that are attached to the arguments. In preview, the fix is marked safe if no comments are present.",
