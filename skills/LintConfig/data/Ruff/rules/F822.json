  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undefined-export] [Message: Undefined name <code>{name}</code> in <code>__all__</code>] What it does Checks for undefined names in __all__. Why is this bad? In Python, the __all__ variable is used to define the names that are exported when a module is imported as a wildcard (e.g., from foo import *). The names in __all__ must be defined in the module, but are included as strings. Including an undefined name in __all__ is likely to raise NameError at runtime, when the module is imported. In preview, this rule will flag undefined names in __init__.py file, even if those names implicitly refer to other modules in the package. Users that rely on implicit exports should disable this rule in __init__.py files via lint.per-file-ignores. Example from foo import bar __all__ = [\"bar\", \"baz\"] # undefined name `baz` in `__all__` Use instead: from foo import bar, baz __all__ = [\"bar\", \"baz\"]",
