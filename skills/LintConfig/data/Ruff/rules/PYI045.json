  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: iter-method-return-iterable] [Message: <code>__aiter__</code> methods should return an <code>AsyncIterator</code>, not an <code>AsyncIterable</code>] What it does Checks for __iter__ methods in stubs that return Iterable[T] instead of an Iterator[T]. Why is this bad? __iter__ methods should always should return an Iterator of some kind, not an Iterable. In Python, an Iterable is an object that has an __iter__ method; an Iterator is an object that has __iter__ and __next__ methods. All __iter__ methods are expected to return Iterators. Type checkers may not always recognize an object as being iterable if its __iter__ method does not return an Iterator. Every Iterator is an Iterable, but not every Iterable is an Iterator. For example, list is an Iterable, but not an Iterator; you can obtain an iterator over a list's elements by passing the list to iter(): >>> import collections.abc >>> x = [42] >>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterable) True >>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterator) False >>> next(x) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator >>> y = iter(x) >>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterable) True >>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterator) True >>> next(y) 42 Using Iterable rather than Iterator as a return type for an __iter__ methods would imply that you would not necessarily be able to call next() on the returned object, violating the expectations of the interface. Example import collections.abc class Klass: def __iter__(self) -> collections.abc.Iterable[str]: ... Use instead: import collections.abc class Klass: def __iter__(self) -> collections.abc.Iterator[str]: ...",
