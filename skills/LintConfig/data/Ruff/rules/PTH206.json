  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-sep-split] [Message: Replace <code>.split(os.sep)</code> with <code>Path.parts</code>] What it does Checks for uses of .split(os.sep) Why is this bad? The pathlib module in the standard library should be used for path manipulation. It provides a high-level API with the functionality needed for common operations on Path objects. Example If not all parts of the path are needed, then the name and parent attributes of the Path object should be used. Otherwise, the parts attribute can be used as shown in the last example. import os \"path/to/file_name.txt\".split(os.sep)[-1] \"path/to/file_name.txt\".split(os.sep)[-2] # Iterating over the path parts if any(part in blocklist for part in \"my/file/path\".split(os.sep)): ... Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(\"path/to/file_name.txt\").name Path(\"path/to/file_name.txt\").parent.name # Iterating over the path parts if any(part in blocklist for part in Path(\"my/file/path\").parts): ... Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than working directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
