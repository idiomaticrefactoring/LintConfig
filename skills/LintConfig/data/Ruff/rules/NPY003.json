  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: numpy-deprecated-function] [Message: <code>np.{existing}</code> is deprecated; use <code>np.{replacement}</code> instead] What it does Checks for uses of deprecated NumPy functions. Why is this bad? When NumPy functions are deprecated, they are usually replaced with newer, more efficient versions, or with functions that are more consistent with the rest of the NumPy API. Prefer newer APIs over deprecated ones. Example import numpy as np np.alltrue([True, False]) Use instead: import numpy as np np.all([True, False])",
