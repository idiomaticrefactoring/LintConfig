  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: signature-in-docstring] [Message: First line should not be the function's signature] What it does Checks for function docstrings that include the function's signature in the summary line. Why is this bad? PEP 257 recommends against including a function's signature in its docstring. Instead, consider using type annotations as a form of documentation for the function's parameters and return value. This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the google and pep257 conventions, and disabled when using the numpy convention. Example def foo(a, b): \"\"\"foo(a: int, b: int) -> list[int]\"\"\" Use instead: def foo(a: int, b: int) -> list[int]: \"\"\"Return a list of a and b.\"\"\"",
