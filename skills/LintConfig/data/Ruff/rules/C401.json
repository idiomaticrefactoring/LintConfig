  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-generator-set] [Message: Unnecessary generator (rewrite using <code>set()</code>)] What it does Checks for unnecessary generators that can be rewritten as set comprehensions (or with set() directly). Why is this bad? It is unnecessary to use set around a generator expression, since there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. Using a comprehension is clearer and more idiomatic. Further, if the comprehension can be removed entirely, as in the case of set(x for x in foo), it's better to use set(foo) directly, since it's even more direct. Example set(f(x) for x in foo) set(x for x in foo) set((x for x in foo)) Use instead: {f(x) for x in foo} set(foo) set(foo) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
