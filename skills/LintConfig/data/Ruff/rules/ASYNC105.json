  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: trio-sync-call] [Message: Call to <code>{method_name}</code> is not immediately awaited] What it does Checks for calls to trio functions that are not immediately awaited. Why is this bad? Many of the functions exposed by trio are asynchronous, and must be awaited to take effect. Calling a trio function without an await can lead to RuntimeWarning diagnostics and unexpected behaviour. Example import trio async def double_sleep(x): trio.sleep(2 * x) Use instead: import trio async def double_sleep(x): await trio.sleep(2 * x) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as adding an await to a function call changes its semantics and runtime behavior.",
