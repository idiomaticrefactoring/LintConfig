  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version-slice3] [Message: <code>sys.version[:3]</code> referenced (python3.10), use <code>sys.version_info</code>] What it does Checks for uses of sys.version[:3]. Why is this bad? If the current major or minor version consists of multiple digits, sys.version[:3] will truncate the version number (e.g., \"3.10\" would become \"3.1\"). This is likely unintended, and can lead to subtle bugs if the version string is used to test against a specific Python version. Instead, use sys.version_info to access the current major and minor version numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples without issue. Example import sys sys.version[:3] # Evaluates to \"3.1\" on Python 3.10. Use instead: import sys sys.version_info[:2] # Evaluates to (3, 10) on Python 3.10.",
