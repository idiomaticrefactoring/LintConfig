  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unprefixed-type-param] [Message: Name of private <code>{kind}</code> must start with <code>_</code>] What it does Checks that type TypeVars, ParamSpecs, and TypeVarTuples in stubs have names prefixed with _. Why is this bad? Prefixing type parameters with _ avoids accidentally exposing names internal to the stub. Example from typing import TypeVar T = TypeVar(\"T\") Use instead: from typing import TypeVar _T = TypeVar(\"_T\")",
