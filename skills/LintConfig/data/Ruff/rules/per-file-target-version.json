For example, if you have a project with a minimum\nsupported Python version of 3.9 but a subdirectory of developer scripts that want to use a\nnewer feature like the `match` statement from Python 3.10, you can use\n`per-file-target-version` to specify `\"developer_scripts/*.py\" = \"py310\"`.\n\nThis setting is used by the linter to enforce any enabled version-specific lint rules, as\nwell as by the formatter for any version-specific formatting options, such as parenthesizing\ncontext managers on Python 3.10+.",
