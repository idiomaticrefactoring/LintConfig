  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: static-join-to-f-string] [Message: Consider <code>{expression}</code> instead of string join] What it does Checks for str.join calls that can be replaced with f-strings. Why is this bad? f-strings are more readable and generally preferred over str.join calls. Example \" \".join((foo, bar)) Use instead: f\"{foo} {bar}\" Fix safety The fix is always marked unsafe because the evaluation of the f-string expressions will default to calling the __format__ method of each object, whereas str.join expects each object to be an instance of str and uses the corresponding string. Therefore it is possible for the values of the resulting strings to differ, or for one expression to raise an exception while the other does not.",
