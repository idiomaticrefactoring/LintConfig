  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-fixture-finalizer-callback] [Message: Use <code>yield</code> instead of <code>request.addfinalizer</code>] What it does Checks for unnecessary request.addfinalizer usages in pytest fixtures. Why is this bad? pytest offers two ways to perform cleanup in fixture code. The first is sequential (via the yield statement), the second callback-based (via request.addfinalizer). The sequential approach is more readable and should be preferred, unless the fixture uses the \"factory as fixture\" pattern. Example import pytest @pytest.fixture() def my_fixture(request): resource = acquire_resource() request.addfinalizer(resource.release) return resource Use instead: import pytest @pytest.fixture() def my_fixture(): resource = acquire_resource() yield resource resource.release() # \"factory-as-fixture\" pattern @pytest.fixture() def my_factory(request): def create_resource(arg): resource = acquire_resource(arg) request.addfinalizer(resource.release) return resource return create_resource",
