  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-literal-set] [Message: Unnecessary {kind} literal (rewrite as a set literal)] What it does Checks for set() calls that take unnecessary list or tuple literals as arguments. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a call to set(). Instead, the expression can be rewritten as a set literal. Example set([1, 2]) set((1, 2)) set([]) Use instead: {1, 2} {1, 2} set() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
