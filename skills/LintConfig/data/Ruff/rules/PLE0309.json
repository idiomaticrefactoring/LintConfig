  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-hash-return-type] [Message: <code>__hash__</code> does not return an integer] What it does Checks for __hash__ implementations that return non-integer values. Why is this bad? The __hash__ method should return an integer. Returning a different type may cause unexpected behavior. Note: bool is a subclass of int, so it's technically valid for __hash__ to return True or False. However, for consistency with other rules, Ruff will still emit a diagnostic when __hash__ returns a bool. Example class Foo: def __hash__(self): return \"2\" Use instead: class Foo: def __hash__(self): return 2",
