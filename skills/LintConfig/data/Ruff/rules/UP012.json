  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-encode-utf8] [Message: Unnecessary call to <code>encode</code> as UTF-8] What it does Checks for unnecessary calls to encode as UTF-8. Why is this bad? UTF-8 is the default encoding in Python, so there is no need to call encode when UTF-8 is the desired encoding. Instead, use a bytes literal. Example \"foo\".encode(\"utf-8\") Use instead: b\"foo\"",
