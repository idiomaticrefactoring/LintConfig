  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unsupported-method-call-on-all] [Message: Calling <code>.{name}()</code> on <code>__all__</code> may not be supported by all type checkers (use <code>+=</code> instead)] What it does Checks that append, extend and remove methods are not called on __all__. Why is this bad? Different type checkers have varying levels of support for calling these methods on __all__. Instead, use the += operator to add items to __all__, which is known to be supported by all major type checkers. Example import sys __all__ = [\"A\", \"B\"] if sys.version_info >= (3, 10): __all__.append(\"C\") if sys.version_info >= (3, 11): __all__.remove(\"B\") Use instead: import sys __all__ = [\"A\"] if sys.version_info < (3, 11): __all__ += [\"B\"] if sys.version_info >= (3, 10): __all__ += [\"C\"]",
