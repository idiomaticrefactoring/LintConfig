  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-type-union] [Message: Multiple <code>type</code> members in a union. Combine them into one, e.g., <code>type[{union_str}]</code>.] What it does Checks for the presence of multiple types in a union. Why is this bad? type[T | S] has identical semantics to type[T] | type[S] in a type annotation, but is cleaner and more concise. Example field: type[int] | type[float] | str Use instead: field: type[int | float] | str Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments. Note that while the fix may flatten nested unions into a single top-level union, the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.",
