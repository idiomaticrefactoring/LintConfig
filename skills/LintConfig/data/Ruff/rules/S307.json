Why is this bad? The eval() function is insecure as it enables arbitrary code execution. If you need to evaluate an expression from a string, consider using ast.literal_eval() instead, which will raise an exception if the expression is not a valid Python literal. In preview, this rule will also flag references to eval. Example x = eval(input(\"Enter a number: \")) Use instead: from ast import literal_eval x = literal_eval(input(\"Enter a number: \"))",
