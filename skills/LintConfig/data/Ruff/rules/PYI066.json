  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: bad-version-info-order] [Message: Put branches for newer Python versions first when branching on <code>sys.version_info</code> comparisons] What it does Checks for code that branches on sys.version_info comparisons where branches corresponding to older Python versions come before branches corresponding to newer Python versions. Why is this bad? As a convention, branches that correspond to newer Python versions should come first. This makes it easier to understand the desired behavior, which typically corresponds to the latest Python versions. This rule enforces the convention by checking for if tests that compare sys.version_info with < rather than >=. By default, this rule only applies to stub files. In preview, it will also flag this anti-pattern in non-stub files. Example import sys if sys.version_info < (3, 10): def read_data(x, *, preserve_order=True): ... else: def read_data(x): ... Use instead: if sys.version_info >= (3, 10): def read_data(x): ... else: def read_data(x, *, preserve_order=True): ...",
