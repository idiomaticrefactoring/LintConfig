  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: no-space-after-block-comment] [Message: Block comment should start with <code>#</code>] What it does Checks for block comments that lack a single space after the leading # character. Why is this bad? Per PEP 8, \"Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.\" Block comments should start with a # followed by a single space. Shebangs (lines starting with #!, at the top of a file) are exempt from this rule. Example #Block comment Use instead: # Block comment",
