  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: unnecessary-lambda] [Message: Lambda may be unnecessary; consider inlining inner function] What it does Checks for lambda definitions that consist of a single function call with the same arguments as the lambda itself. Why is this bad? When a lambda is used to wrap a function call, and merely propagates the lambda arguments to that function, it can typically be replaced with the function itself, removing a level of indirection. Example df.apply(lambda x: str(x)) Use instead: df.apply(str) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for two primary reasons. First, the lambda body itself could contain an effect. For example, replacing lambda x, y: (func()(x, y)) with func() would lead to a change in behavior, as func() would be evaluated eagerly when defining the lambda, rather than when the lambda is called. However, even when the lambda body itself is pure, the lambda may change the argument names, which can lead to a change in behavior when callers pass arguments by name. For example, replacing foo = lambda x, y: func(x, y) with foo = func, where func is defined as def func(a, b): return a + b, would be a breaking change for callers that execute the lambda by passing arguments by name, as in: foo(x=1, y=2). Since func does not define the arguments x and y, unlike the lambda, the call would raise a TypeError.",
