  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: zip-dict-keys-and-values] [Message: Use <code>{expected}</code> instead of <code>{actual}</code>] What it does Checks for use of zip() to iterate over keys and values of a dictionary at once. Why is this bad? The dict type provides an .items() method which is faster and more readable. Example flag_stars = {\"USA\": 50, \"Slovenia\": 3, \"Panama\": 2, \"Australia\": 6} for country, stars in zip(flag_stars.keys(), flag_stars.values()): print(f\"{country}'s flag has {stars} stars.\") Use instead: flag_stars = {\"USA\": 50, \"Slovenia\": 3, \"Panama\": 2, \"Australia\": 6} for country, stars in flag_stars.items(): print(f\"{country}'s flag has {stars} stars.\") Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.",
