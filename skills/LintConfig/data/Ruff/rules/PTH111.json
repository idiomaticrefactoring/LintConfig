  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-path-expanduser] [Message: <code>os.path.expanduser()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.expanduser()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.path.expanduser. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os.path. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.expanduser() can improve readability over the os.path module's counterparts (e.g., as os.path.expanduser()). Examples import os os.path.expanduser(\"~/films/Monty Python\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(\"~/films/Monty Python\").expanduser() Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python. Fix Safety This rule's fix is always marked as unsafe because the behaviors of os.path.expanduser and Path.expanduser differ when a user's home directory can't be resolved: os.path.expanduser returns the input unchanged, while Path.expanduser raises RuntimeError. Additionally, the fix is marked as unsafe because os.path.expanduser() returns str or bytes (AnyStr), while Path.expanduser() returns a Path object. This change in return type can break code that uses the return value.",
