  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: yield-from-in-async-function] [Message: <code>yield from</code> statement in async function; use <code>async for</code> instead] What it does Checks for uses of yield from in async functions. Why is this bad? Python doesn't support the use of yield from in async functions, and will raise a SyntaxError in such cases. Instead, considering refactoring the code to use an async for loop instead. Example async def numbers(): yield from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Use instead: async def numbers(): async for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: yield number",
