  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assignment-default-in-stub] [Message: Only simple default values allowed for assignments] What it does Checks for assignments in stubs with default values that are not \"simple\" (i.e., int, float, complex, bytes, str, bool, None, ..., or simple container literals). Why is this bad? Stub (.pyi) files exist to define type hints, and are not evaluated at runtime. As such, assignments in stub files should not include values, as they are ignored by type checkers. However, the use of such values may be useful for IDEs and other consumers of stub files, and so \"simple\" values may be worth including and are permitted by this rule. Instead of including and reproducing a complex value, use ... to indicate that the assignment has a default value, but that the value is non-simple or varies according to the current platform or Python version. Example foo: str = bar() Use instead: foo: str = ...",
