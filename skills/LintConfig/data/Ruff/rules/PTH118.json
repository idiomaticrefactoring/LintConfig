  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-path-join] [Message: <code>os.{module}.join()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path</code> with <code>/</code> operator] What it does Checks for uses of os.path.join. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os.path. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.joinpath() or the / operator can improve readability over the os.path module's counterparts (e.g., os.path.join()). Examples import os os.path.join(os.path.join(ROOT_PATH, \"folder\"), \"file.py\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(ROOT_PATH) / \"folder\" / \"file.py\" Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
