  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: docstring-extraneous-yields] [Message: Docstring has a \"Yields\" section but the function doesn't yield anything] What it does Checks for function docstrings with unnecessary \"Yields\" sections. Why is this bad? A function that doesn't yield anything should not have a \"Yields\" section in its docstring. This rule is not enforced for abstract methods. It is also ignored for \"stub functions\": functions where the body only consists of pass, ..., raise NotImplementedError, or similar. Example def say_hello(n: int) -> None: \"\"\"Says hello to the user. Args: n: Number of times to say hello. Yields: Doesn't yield anything. \"\"\" for _ in range(n): print(\"Hello!\") Use instead: def say_hello(n: int) -> None: \"\"\"Says hello to the user. Args: n: Number of times to say hello. \"\"\" for _ in range(n): print(\"Hello!\")",
