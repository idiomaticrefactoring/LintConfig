  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: convert-named-tuple-functional-to-class] [Message: Convert <code>{name}</code> from <code>NamedTuple</code> functional to class syntax] What it does Checks for NamedTuple declarations that use functional syntax. Why is this bad? NamedTuple subclasses can be defined either through a functional syntax (Foo = NamedTuple(...)) or a class syntax (class Foo(NamedTuple): ...). The class syntax is more readable and generally preferred over the functional syntax, which exists primarily for backwards compatibility with collections.namedtuple. Example from typing import NamedTuple Foo = NamedTuple(\"Foo\", [(\"a\", int), (\"b\", str)]) Use instead: from typing import NamedTuple class Foo(NamedTuple): a: int b: str Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments within the range of the NamedTuple definition, as these will be dropped by the autofix.",
