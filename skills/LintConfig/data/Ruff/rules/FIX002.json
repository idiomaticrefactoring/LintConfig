  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: line-contains-todo] [Message: Line contains TODO, consider resolving the issue] What it does Checks for \"TODO\" comments. Why is this bad? \"TODO\" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved (usually, a missing feature, optimization, or refactoring opportunity). Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code. Note that if you use \"TODO\" comments as a form of documentation (e.g., to provide context for future work), this rule may not be appropriate for your project. Example def greet(name): return f\"Hello, {name}!\" # TODO: Add support for custom greetings.",
