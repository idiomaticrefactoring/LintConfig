  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: default-factory-kwarg] [Message: <code>default_factory</code> is a positional-only argument to <code>defaultdict</code>] What it does Checks for incorrect usages of default_factory as a keyword argument when initializing a defaultdict. Why is this bad? The defaultdict constructor accepts a callable as its first argument. For example, it's common to initialize a defaultdict with int or list via defaultdict(int) or defaultdict(list), to create a dictionary that returns 0 or [] respectively when a key is missing. The default factory must be provided as a positional argument, as all keyword arguments to defaultdict are interpreted as initial entries in the dictionary. For example, defaultdict(foo=1, bar=2) will create a dictionary with {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": 2} as its initial entries. As such, defaultdict(default_factory=list) will create a dictionary with {\"default_factory\": list} as its initial entry, instead of a dictionary that returns [] when a key is missing. Specifying a default_factory keyword argument is almost always a mistake, and one that type checkers can't reliably detect. Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting default_factory from a keyword to a positional argument will change the behavior of the code, even if the keyword argument was used erroneously. Example defaultdict(default_factory=int) defaultdict(default_factory=list) Use instead: defaultdict(int) defaultdict(list)",
