  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: runtime-string-union] [Message: Invalid string member in <code>X | Y</code>-style union type] What it does Checks for the presence of string literals in X | Y-style union types. Why is this bad? PEP 604 introduced a new syntax for union type annotations based on the | operator. While Python's type annotations can typically be wrapped in strings to avoid runtime evaluation, the use of a string member within an X | Y-style union type will cause a runtime error. Instead, remove the quotes, wrap the entire union in quotes, or use from __future__ import annotations to disable runtime evaluation of annotations entirely. Example var: \"Foo\" | None class Foo: ... Use instead: from __future__ import annotations var: Foo | None class Foo: ... Or, extend the quotes to include the entire union: var: \"Foo | None\" class Foo: ...",
