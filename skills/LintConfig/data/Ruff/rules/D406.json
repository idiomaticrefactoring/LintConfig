  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-new-line-after-section-name] [Message: Section name should end with a newline (\"{name}\")] What it does Checks for section headers in docstrings that are followed by non-newline characters. Why is this bad? This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline numpy-style docstrings. Multiline numpy-style docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections. Each section has a section header and a section body. The section header should be followed by a newline, rather than by some other character (like a colon). This rule is enabled when using the numpy convention, and disabled when using the google or pep257 conventions. Example # The `Parameters`, `Returns` and `Raises` section headers are all followed # by a colon in this function's docstring: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Parameters: ----------- distance : float Distance traveled. time : float Time spent traveling. Returns: -------- float Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: ------- FasterThanLightError If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Parameters ---------- distance : float Distance traveled. time : float Time spent traveling. Returns ------- float Speed as distance divided by time. Raises ------ FasterThanLightError If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
