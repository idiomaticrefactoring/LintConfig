  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version2] [Message: <code>sys.version[2]</code> referenced (python3.10), use <code>sys.version_info</code>] What it does Checks for uses of sys.version[2]. Why is this bad? If the current major or minor version consists of multiple digits, sys.version[2] will select the first digit of the minor number only (e.g., \"3.10\" would evaluate to \"1\"). This is likely unintended, and can lead to subtle bugs if the version is used to test against a minor version number. Instead, use sys.version_info.minor to access the current minor version number. Example import sys sys.version[2] # Evaluates to \"1\" on Python 3.10. Use instead: import sys f\"{sys.version_info.minor}\" # Evaluates to \"10\" on Python 3.10.",
