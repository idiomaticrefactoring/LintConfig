  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: django-non-leading-receiver-decorator] [Message: <code>@receiver</code> decorator must be on top of all the other decorators] What it does Checks that Django's @receiver decorator is listed first, prior to any other decorators. Why is this bad? Django's @receiver decorator is special in that it does not return a wrapped function. Rather, @receiver connects the decorated function to a signal. If any other decorators are listed before @receiver, the decorated function will not be connected to the signal. Example from django.dispatch import receiver from django.db.models.signals import post_save @transaction.atomic @receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel) def my_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs): pass Use instead: from django.dispatch import receiver from django.db.models.signals import post_save @receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel) @transaction.atomic def my_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs): pass",
