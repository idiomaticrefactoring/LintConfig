  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: non-pep646-unpack] [Message: Use <code>*</code> for unpacking] What it does Checks for uses of Unpack[] on Python 3.11 and above, and suggests using * instead. Why is this bad? PEP 646 introduced a new syntax for unpacking sequences based on the * operator. This syntax is more concise and readable than the previous Unpack[] syntax. Example from typing import Unpack def foo(*args: Unpack[tuple[int, ...]]) -> None: pass Use instead: def foo(*args: *tuple[int, ...]) -> None: pass Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as Unpack[T] and *T are considered different values when introspecting types at runtime. However, in most cases, the fix should be safe to apply.",

      "option_description": "The minimum Python version to target, e.g., when considering automatic\ncode upgrades, like rewriting type annotations. Ruff will not propose\nchanges using features that are not available in the given version.\n\nFor example, to represent supporting Python >=3.11 or ==3.11\nspecify target-version = \"py311\".\n\nIf you're already using a pyproject.toml file, we recommend\nproject.requires-python instead, as it's based on Python packaging\nstandards, and will be respected by other tools. For example, Ruff\ntreats the following as identical to target-version = \"py38\":\n\n[project]\nrequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\nIf both are specified, target-version takes precedence over\nrequires-python. See Inferring the Python version\nfor a complete description of how the target-version is determined\nwhen left unspecified.\n\nNote that a stub file can sometimes make use of a typing feature\nbefore it is available at runtime, as long as the stub does not make\nuse of new syntax. For example, a type checker will understand\nint | str in a stub as being a Union type annotation, even if the\ntype checker is run using Python 3.9, despite the fact that the |\noperator can only be used to create union types at runtime on Python\n3.10+. As such, Ruff will often recommend newer features in a stub\nfile than it would for an equivalent runtime file with the same target\nversion.\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\npyproject.tomlruff.toml\n\n\n[tool.ruff]\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"\n\n\n\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"",
