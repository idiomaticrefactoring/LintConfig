  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: blocking-open-call-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not open files with blocking methods like <code>open</code>] What it does Checks that async functions do not open files with blocking methods like open. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library or function. Example async def foo(): with open(\"bar.txt\") as f: contents = f.read() Use instead: import anyio async def foo(): async with await anyio.open_file(\"bar.txt\") as f: contents = await f.read()",
