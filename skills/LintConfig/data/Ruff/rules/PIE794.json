  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-class-field-definition] [Message: Class field <code>{name}</code> is defined multiple times] What it does Checks for duplicate field definitions in classes. Why is this bad? Defining a field multiple times in a class body is redundant and likely a mistake. Example class Person: name = Tom ... name = Ben Use instead: class Person: name = Tom ... Fix safety This fix is always marked as unsafe since we cannot know for certain which assignment was intended.",
