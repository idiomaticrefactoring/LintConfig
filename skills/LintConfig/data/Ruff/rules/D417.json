  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undocumented-param] [Message: Missing argument description in the docstring for <code>{definition}</code>: <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for function docstrings that do not include documentation for all parameters in the function. Why is this bad? This rule helps prevent you from leaving Google-style docstrings unfinished or incomplete. Multiline Google-style docstrings should describe all parameters for the function they are documenting. Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header and a section body. Function docstrings often include a section for function arguments; this rule is concerned with that section only. Note that this rule only checks docstrings with an arguments (e.g. Args) section. This rule is enabled when using the google convention, and disabled when using the pep257 and numpy conventions. Parameters annotated with typing.Unpack are exempt from this rule. This follows the Python typing specification for unpacking keyword arguments. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
