  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-useless-yield-fixture] [Message: No teardown in fixture <code>{name}</code>, use <code>return</code> instead of <code>yield</code>] What it does Checks for unnecessary yield expressions in pytest fixtures. Why is this bad? In pytest fixtures, the yield expression should only be used for fixtures that include teardown code, to clean up the fixture after the test function has finished executing. Example import pytest @pytest.fixture() def my_fixture(): resource = acquire_resource() yield resource Use instead: import pytest @pytest.fixture() def my_fixture_with_teardown(): resource = acquire_resource() yield resource resource.release() @pytest.fixture() def my_fixture_without_teardown(): resource = acquire_resource() return resource",
