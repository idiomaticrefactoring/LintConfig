  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: string-dot-format-extra-named-arguments] [Message: <code>.format</code> call has unused named argument(s): {message}] What it does Checks for str.format calls with unused keyword arguments. Why is this bad? Unused keyword arguments are redundant, and often indicative of a mistake. They should be removed. Example \"Hello, {name}\".format(greeting=\"Hello\", name=\"World\") Use instead: \"Hello, {name}\".format(name=\"World\") Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the unused keyword argument contains a function call with potential side effects, because removing such arguments could change the behavior of the code. For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case: \"Hello, {name}\".format(greeting=print(1), name=\"World\")",
