  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: zip-instead-of-pairwise] [Message: Prefer <code>itertools.pairwise()</code> over <code>zip()</code> when iterating over successive pairs] What it does Checks for use of zip() to iterate over successive pairs of elements. Why is this bad? When iterating over successive pairs of elements, prefer itertools.pairwise() over zip(). itertools.pairwise() is more readable and conveys the intent of the code more clearly. Example letters = \"ABCD\" zip(letters, letters[1:]) # (\"A\", \"B\"), (\"B\", \"C\"), (\"C\", \"D\") Use instead: from itertools import pairwise letters = \"ABCD\" pairwise(letters) # (\"A\", \"B\"), (\"B\", \"C\"), (\"C\", \"D\") Fix safety The fix is always marked unsafe because it assumes that slicing an object (e.g., obj[1:]) produces a value with the same type and iteration behavior as the original object, which is not guaranteed for user-defined types that override __getitem__ without properly handling slices. Moreover, the fix could delete comments.",
