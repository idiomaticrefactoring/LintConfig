  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-not-null] [Message: <code>.notna</code> is preferred to <code>.notnull</code>; functionality is equivalent] What it does Checks for uses of .notnull on Pandas objects. Why is this bad? In the Pandas API, .notna and .notnull are equivalent. For consistency, prefer .notna over .notnull. As a name, .notna more accurately reflects the behavior of the method, since these methods check for NaN and NaT values in addition to None values. Example import pandas as pd animals_df = pd.read_csv(\"animals.csv\") pd.notnull(animals_df) Use instead: import pandas as pd animals_df = pd.read_csv(\"animals.csv\") pd.notna(animals_df)",
