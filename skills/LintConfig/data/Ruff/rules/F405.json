  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undefined-local-with-import-star-usage] [Message: <code>{name}</code> may be undefined, or defined from star imports] What it does Checks for names that might be undefined, but may also be defined in a wildcard import. Why is this bad? Wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *) make it hard to determine which symbols are available in the current namespace. If a module contains a wildcard import, and a name in the current namespace has not been explicitly defined or imported, then it's unclear whether the name is undefined or was imported by the wildcard import. If the name is defined in via a wildcard import, that member should be imported explicitly to avoid confusion. If the name is not defined in a wildcard import, it should be defined or imported. Example from math import * def area(radius): return pi * radius**2 Use instead: from math import pi def area(radius): return pi * radius**2",
