  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: none-not-at-end-of-union] [Message: <code>None</code> not at the end of the type annotation.] What it does Checks for type annotations where None is not at the end of an union. Why is this bad? Type annotation unions are commutative, meaning that the order of the elements does not matter. The None literal represents the absence of a value. For readability, it's preferred to write the more informative type expressions first. Example def func(arg: None | int): ... Use instead: def func(arg: int | None): ...",
