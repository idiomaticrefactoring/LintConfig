  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: duplicate-entry-in-dunder-all] [Message: <code>__all__</code> contains duplicate entries] What it does Detects duplicate elements in __all__ definitions. Why is this bad? Duplicate elements in __all__ serve no purpose and can indicate copy-paste errors or incomplete refactoring. Example __all__ = [ \"DatabaseConnection\", \"Product\", \"User\", \"DatabaseConnection\", # Duplicate ] Use instead: __all__ = [ \"DatabaseConnection\", \"Product\", \"User\", ] Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression, potentially losing important context or documentation. For example: __all__ = [ \"PublicAPI\", # TODO: Remove this in v2.0 \"PublicAPI\", # Deprecated alias ]",
