  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: missing-whitespace-around-arithmetic-operator] [Message: Missing whitespace around arithmetic operator] What it does Checks for missing whitespace arithmetic operators. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends never using more than one space, and always having the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator. For consistency, this rule enforces one space before and after an arithmetic operator (+, -, /, and *). (Note that PEP 8 suggests only adding whitespace around the operator with the lowest precedence, but that authors should \"use [their] own judgment\".) Example number = 40+2 Use instead: number = 40 + 2",
