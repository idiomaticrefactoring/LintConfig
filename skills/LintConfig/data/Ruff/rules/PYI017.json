  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: complex-assignment-in-stub] [Message: Stubs should not contain assignments to attributes or multiple targets] What it does Checks for assignments with multiple or non-name targets in stub files. Why is this bad? In general, stub files should be thought of as \"data files\" for a type checker, and are not intended to be executed. As such, it's useful to enforce that only a subset of Python syntax is allowed in a stub file, to ensure that everything in the stub is unambiguous for the type checker. The need to perform multi-assignment, or assignment to a non-name target, likely indicates a misunderstanding of how stub files are intended to be used. Example from typing import TypeAlias a = b = int class Klass: ... Klass.X: TypeAlias = int Use instead: from typing import TypeAlias a: TypeAlias = int b: TypeAlias = int class Klass: X: TypeAlias = int",
