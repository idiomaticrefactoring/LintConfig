  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: redundant-bool-literal] [Message: <code>Literal[True, False, ...]</code> can be replaced with <code>Literal[...] | bool</code>] What it does Checks for Literal[True, False] type annotations. Why is this bad? Literal[True, False] can be replaced with bool in type annotations, which has the same semantic meaning but is more concise and readable. bool type has exactly two constant instances: True and False. Static type checkers such as mypy treat Literal[True, False] as equivalent to bool in a type annotation. Example from typing import Literal x: Literal[True, False] y: Literal[True, False, \"hello\", \"world\"] Use instead: from typing import Literal x: bool y: Literal[\"hello\", \"world\"] | bool Fix safety The fix for this rule is marked as unsafe, as it may change the semantics of the code. Specifically: Type checkers may not treat bool as equivalent when overloading boolean arguments with Literal[True] and Literal[False] (see, e.g., #14764 and #5421). bool is not strictly equivalent to Literal[True, False], as bool is a subclass of int, and this rule may not apply if the type annotations are used in a numeric context. Further, the Literal slice may contain trailing-line comments which the fix would remove.",
