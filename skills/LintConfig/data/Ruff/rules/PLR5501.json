  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: collapsible-else-if] [Message: Use <code>elif</code> instead of <code>else</code> then <code>if</code>, to reduce indentation] What it does Checks for else blocks that consist of a single if statement. Why is this bad? If an else block contains a single if statement, it can be collapsed into an elif, thus reducing the indentation level. Example def check_sign(value: int) -> None: if value > 0: print(\"Number is positive.\") else: if value < 0: print(\"Number is negative.\") else: print(\"Number is zero.\") Use instead: def check_sign(value: int) -> None: if value > 0: print(\"Number is positive.\") elif value < 0: print(\"Number is negative.\") else: print(\"Number is zero.\")",
