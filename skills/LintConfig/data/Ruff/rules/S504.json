  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: ssl-with-no-version] [Message: <code>ssl.wrap_socket</code> called without an `ssl_version``] What it does Checks for calls to ssl.wrap_socket() without an ssl_version. Why is this bad? This method is known to provide a default value that maximizes compatibility, but permits use of insecure protocols. Example import ssl ssl.wrap_socket() Use instead: import ssl ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)",
