  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-character-esc] [Message: Invalid unescaped character ESC, use \"\\x1b\" instead] What it does Checks for strings that contain the raw control character ESC. Why is this bad? Control characters are displayed differently by different text editors and terminals. By using the \\x1b sequence in lieu of the ESC control character, the string will contain the same value, but will render visibly in all editors. Example x = \"\" Use instead: x = \"\\x1b\"",
