  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: mixed-case-variable-in-class-scope] [Message: Variable <code>{name}</code> in class scope should not be mixedCase] What it does Checks for class variable names that follow the mixedCase convention. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends that variable names should be lower case and separated by underscores (also known as snake_case). Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Variable names follow the same convention as function names. mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility. Example class MyClass: myVariable = \"hello\" another_variable = \"world\" Use instead: class MyClass: my_variable = \"hello\" another_variable = \"world\"",
