  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-cast-to-int] [Message: Value being cast to <code>int</code> is already an integer] What it does Checks for int conversions of values that are already integers. Why is this bad? Such a conversion is unnecessary. Known problems This rule may produce false positives for round, math.ceil, math.floor, and math.trunc calls when values override the __round__, __ceil__, __floor__, or __trunc__ operators such that they don't return an integer. Example int(len([])) int(round(foo, None)) Use instead: len([]) round(foo) Fix safety The fix for round, math.ceil, math.floor, and math.truncate is unsafe because removing the int conversion can change the semantics for values overriding the __round__, __ceil__, __floor__, or __trunc__ dunder methods such that they don't return an integer.",
