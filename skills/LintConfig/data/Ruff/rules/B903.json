  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: class-as-data-structure] [Message: Class could be dataclass or namedtuple] What it does Checks for classes that only have a public __init__ method, without base classes and decorators. Why is this bad? Classes with just an __init__ are possibly better off being a dataclass or a namedtuple, which have less boilerplate.
