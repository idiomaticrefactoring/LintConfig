  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: potential-index-error] [Message: Expression is likely to raise <code>IndexError</code>] What it does Checks for hard-coded sequence accesses that are known to be out of bounds. Why is this bad? Attempting to access a sequence with an out-of-bounds index will cause an IndexError to be raised at runtime. When the sequence and index are defined statically (e.g., subscripts on list and tuple literals, with integer indexes), such errors can be detected ahead of time. Example print([0, 1, 2][3])",
