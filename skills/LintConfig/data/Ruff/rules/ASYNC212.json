  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blocking-http-call-httpx-in-async-function] [Message: Blocking httpx method {name}.{call}() in async context, use httpx.AsyncClient] What it does Checks that async functions do not use blocking httpx clients. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking HTTP call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the HTTP response, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of using the blocking httpx client, use the asynchronous client. Example import httpx async def fetch(): client = httpx.Client() response = client.get(...) Use instead: import httpx async def fetch(): async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.get(...)",
