  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: subprocess-popen-with-shell-equals-true] [Message: <code>subprocess</code> call with <code>shell=True</code> seems safe, but may be changed in the future; consider rewriting without <code>shell</code>] What it does Check for method calls that initiate a subprocess with a shell. Why is this bad? Starting a subprocess with a shell can allow attackers to execute arbitrary shell commands. Consider starting the process without a shell call and sanitize the input to mitigate the risk of shell injection. Example import subprocess subprocess.run(\"ls -l\", shell=True) Use instead: import subprocess subprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\"])",
