  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-mktemp-usage] [Message: Use of insecure and deprecated function (<code>mktemp</code>)] What it does Checks for uses of tempfile.mktemp. Why is this bad? tempfile.mktemp returns a pathname of a file that does not exist at the time the call is made; then, the caller is responsible for creating the file and subsequently using it. This is insecure because another process could create a file with the same name between the time the function returns and the time the caller creates the file. tempfile.mktemp is deprecated in favor of tempfile.mkstemp which creates the file when it is called. Consider using tempfile.mkstemp instead, either directly or via a context manager such as tempfile.TemporaryFile. In preview, this rule will also flag references to tempfile.mktemp. Example import tempfile tmp_file = tempfile.mktemp() with open(tmp_file, \"w\") as file: file.write(\"Hello, world!\") Use instead: import tempfile with tempfile.TemporaryFile() as file: file.write(\"Hello, world!\")",
