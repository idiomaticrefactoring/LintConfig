  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: call-with-shell-equals-true] [Message: Function call with <code>shell=True</code> parameter identified, security issue] What it does Checks for method calls that set the shell parameter to true or another truthy value when invoking a subprocess. Why is this bad? Setting the shell parameter to true or another truthy value when invoking a subprocess can introduce security vulnerabilities, as it allows shell metacharacters and whitespace to be passed to child processes, potentially leading to shell injection attacks. It is recommended to avoid using shell=True unless absolutely necessary and, when used, to ensure that all inputs are properly sanitized and quoted to prevent such vulnerabilities. Known problems Prone to false positives as it is triggered on any function call with a shell=True parameter. Example import my_custom_subprocess user_input = input(\"Enter a command: \") my_custom_subprocess.run(user_input, shell=True)",
