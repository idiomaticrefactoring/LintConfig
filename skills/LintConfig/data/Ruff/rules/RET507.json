  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: superfluous-else-continue] [Message: Unnecessary <code>{branch}</code> after <code>continue</code> statement] What it does Checks for else statements with a continue statement in the preceding if block. Why is this bad? The else statement is not needed, as the continue statement will always continue onto the next iteration of a loop. Removing the else will reduce nesting and make the code more readable. Example def foo(bar, baz): for i in bar: if i < baz: continue else: x = 0 Use instead: def foo(bar, baz): for i in bar: if i < baz: continue x = 0",
