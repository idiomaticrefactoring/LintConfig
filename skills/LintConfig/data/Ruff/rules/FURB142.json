  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: for-loop-set-mutations] [Message: Use of <code>set.{}()</code> in a for loop] What it does Checks for code that updates a set with the contents of an iterable by using a for loop to call .add() or .discard() on each element separately. Why is this bad? When adding or removing a batch of elements to or from a set, it's more idiomatic to use a single method call rather than adding or removing elements one by one. Example s = set() for x in (1, 2, 3): s.add(x) for x in (1, 2, 3): s.discard(x) Use instead: s = set() s.update((1, 2, 3)) s.difference_update((1, 2, 3)) Fix safety The fix will be marked as unsafe if applying the fix would delete any comments. Otherwise, it is marked as safe.",
