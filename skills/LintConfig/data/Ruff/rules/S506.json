  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unsafe-yaml-load] [Message: Probable use of unsafe loader <code>{name}</code> with <code>yaml.load</code>. Allows instantiation of arbitrary objects. Consider <code>yaml.safe_load</code>.] What it does Checks for uses of the yaml.load function. Why is this bad? Running the yaml.load function over untrusted YAML files is insecure, as yaml.load allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects, which can then be used to execute arbitrary code. Instead, consider using yaml.safe_load, which allows for the creation of simple Python objects like integers and lists, but prohibits the creation of more complex objects like functions and classes. Example import yaml yaml.load(untrusted_yaml) Use instead: import yaml yaml.safe_load(untrusted_yaml)",
