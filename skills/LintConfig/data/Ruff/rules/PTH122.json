  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-path-splitext] [Message: <code>os.path.splitext()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.suffix</code>, <code>Path.stem</code>, and <code>Path.parent</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.path.splitext. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os.path. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.suffix and Path.stem can improve readability over the os.path module's counterparts (e.g., os.path.splitext()). os.path.splitext() specifically returns a tuple of the file root and extension (e.g., given splitext('/foo/bar.py'), os.path.splitext() returns (\"foo/bar\", \".py\"). These outputs can be reconstructed through a combination of Path.suffix (\".py\"), Path.stem (\"bar\"), and Path.parent (\"foo\"). Examples import os (root, ext) = os.path.splitext(\"foo/bar.py\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path path = Path(\"foo/bar.py\") root = path.parent / path.stem ext = path.suffix Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
