  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: yoda-conditions] [Message: Yoda condition detected] What it does Checks for conditions that position a constant on the left-hand side of the comparison operator, rather than the right-hand side. Why is this bad? These conditions (sometimes referred to as \"Yoda conditions\") are less readable than conditions that place the variable on the left-hand side of the comparison operator. In some languages, Yoda conditions are used to prevent accidental assignment in conditions (i.e., accidental uses of the = operator, instead of the == operator). However, Python does not allow assignments in conditions unless using the := operator, so Yoda conditions provide no benefit in this regard. Example if \"Foo\" == foo: ... Use instead: if foo == \"Foo\": ...",
