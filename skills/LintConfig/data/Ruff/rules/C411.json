  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-list-call] [Message: Unnecessary <code>list()</code> call (remove the outer call to <code>list()</code>)] What it does Checks for unnecessary list() calls around list comprehensions. Why is this bad? It is redundant to use a list() call around a list comprehension. Example list([f(x) for x in foo]) Use instead [f(x) for x in foo] Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
