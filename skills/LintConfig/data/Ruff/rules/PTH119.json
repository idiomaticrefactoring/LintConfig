  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-path-basename] [Message: <code>os.path.basename()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.name</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.path.basename. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os.path. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.name can improve readability over the os.path module's counterparts (e.g., os.path.basename()). Examples import os os.path.basename(__file__) Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(__file__).name Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python. Fix Safety This rule's fix is always marked as unsafe because the replacement is not always semantically equivalent to the original code. In particular, pathlib performs path normalization, which can alter the result compared to os.path.basename. For example, this normalization: Collapses consecutive slashes (e.g., \"a//b\" → \"a/b\"). Removes trailing slashes (e.g., \"a/b/\" → \"a/b\"). Eliminates \".\" (e.g., \"a/./b\" → \"a/b\"). As a result, code relying on the exact string returned by os.path.basename may behave differently after the fix.",
