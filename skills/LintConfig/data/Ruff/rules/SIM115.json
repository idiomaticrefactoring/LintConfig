  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: open-file-with-context-handler] [Message: Use a context manager for opening files] What it does Checks for cases where files are opened (e.g., using the builtin open() function) without using a context manager. Why is this bad? If a file is opened without a context manager, it is not guaranteed that the file will be closed (e.g., if an exception is raised), which can cause resource leaks. The rule detects a wide array of IO calls where context managers could be used, such as open, pathlib.Path(...).open(), tempfile.TemporaryFile() ortarfile.TarFile(...).gzopen(). Example file = open(\"foo.txt\") ... file.close() Use instead: with open(\"foo.txt\") as file: ...",
