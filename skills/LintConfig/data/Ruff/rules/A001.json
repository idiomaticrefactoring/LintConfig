  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: builtin-variable-shadowing] [Message: Variable <code>{name}</code> is shadowing a Python builtin] What it does Checks for variable (and function) assignments that use the same names as builtins. Why is this bad? Reusing a builtin name for the name of a variable increases the difficulty of reading and maintaining the code, and can cause non-obvious errors, as readers may mistake the variable for the builtin and vice versa. Builtins can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the lint.flake8-builtins.ignorelist configuration option. Example def find_max(list_of_lists): max = 0 for flat_list in list_of_lists: for value in flat_list: max = max(max, value) # TypeError: 'int' object is not callable return max Use instead: def find_max(list_of_lists): result = 0 for flat_list in list_of_lists: for value in flat_list: result = max(result, value) return result",
