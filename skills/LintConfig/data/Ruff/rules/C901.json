  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: complex-structure] [Message: <code>{name}</code> is too complex ({complexity} > {max_complexity})] What it does Checks for functions with a high McCabe complexity. Why is this bad? The McCabe complexity of a function is a measure of the complexity of the control flow graph of the function. It is calculated by adding one to the number of decision points in the function. A decision point is a place in the code where the program has a choice of two or more paths to follow. Functions with a high complexity are hard to understand and maintain. Example def foo(a, b, c): if a: if b: if c: return 1 else: return 2 else: return 3 else: return 4 Use instead: def foo(a, b, c): if not a: return 4 if not b: return 3 if not c: return 2 return 1",
