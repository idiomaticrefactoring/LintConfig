  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: django-all-with-model-form] [Message: Do not use <code>__all__</code> with <code>ModelForm</code>, use <code>fields</code> instead] What it does Checks for the use of fields = \"__all__\" in Django ModelForm classes. Why is this bad? If a ModelForm includes the fields = \"__all__\" attribute, any new field that is added to the model will automatically be exposed for modification. Example from django.forms import ModelForm class PostForm(ModelForm): class Meta: model = Post fields = \"__all__\" Use instead: from django.forms import ModelForm class PostForm(ModelForm): class Meta: model = Post fields = [\"title\", \"content\"]",
  "option": {}
