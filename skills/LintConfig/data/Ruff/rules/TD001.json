  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-todo-tag] [Message: Invalid TODO tag: <code>{tag}</code>] What it does Checks that a TODO comment is labelled with \"TODO\". Why is this bad? Ambiguous tags reduce code visibility and can lead to dangling TODOs. For example, if a comment is tagged with \"FIXME\" rather than \"TODO\", it may be overlooked by future readers. Note that this rule will only flag \"FIXME\" and \"XXX\" tags as incorrect. Example # FIXME(ruff): this should get fixed! Use instead: # TODO(ruff): this is now fixed!",
