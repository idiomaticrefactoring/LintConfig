  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: no-slots-in-tuple-subclass] [Message: Subclasses of <code>tuple</code> should define <code>__slots__</code>] What it does Checks for subclasses of tuple that lack a __slots__ definition. Why is this bad? In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory overhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory savings. Subclasses of tuple inherit all the attributes and methods of the built-in tuple class. Since tuples are typically immutable, they don't require additional attributes beyond what the tuple class provides. Defining __slots__ for subclasses of tuple prevents the creation of a dictionary for each instance, reducing memory consumption. Example class Foo(tuple): pass Use instead: class Foo(tuple): __slots__ = ()",
