  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: iteration-over-set] [Message: Use a sequence type instead of a <code>set</code> when iterating over values] What it does Checks for iteration over a set literal where each element in the set is itself a literal value. Why is this bad? Iterating over a set is less efficient than iterating over a sequence type, like list or tuple. Example for number in {1, 2, 3}: ... Use instead: for number in (1, 2, 3): ...",
