  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-numeric-union] [Message: Use <code>{supertype}</code> instead of <code>{subtype} | {supertype}</code>] What it does Checks for parameter annotations that contain redundant unions between builtin numeric types (e.g., int | float). Why is this bad? The typing specification states: Python’s numeric types complex, float and int are not subtypes of each other, but to support common use cases, the type system contains a straightforward shortcut: when an argument is annotated as having type float, an argument of type int is acceptable; similar, for an argument annotated as having type complex, arguments of type float or int are acceptable. As such, a union that includes both int and float is redundant in the specific context of a parameter annotation, as it is equivalent to a union that only includes float. For readability and clarity, unions should omit redundant elements. Example def foo(x: float | int | str) -> None: ... Use instead: def foo(x: float | str) -> None: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments. Note that while the fix may flatten nested unions into a single top-level union, the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.",
