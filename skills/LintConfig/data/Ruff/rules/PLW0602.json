  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: global-variable-not-assigned] [Message: Using global for <code>{name}</code> but no assignment is done] What it does Checks for global variables that are not assigned a value in the current scope. Why is this bad? The global keyword allows an inner scope to modify a variable declared in the outer scope. If the variable is not modified within the inner scope, there is no need to use global. Example DEBUG = True def foo(): global DEBUG if DEBUG: print(\"foo() called\") ... Use instead: DEBUG = True def foo(): if DEBUG: print(\"foo() called\") ...",
