  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: singledispatchmethod-function] [Message: <code>@singledispatchmethod</code> decorator should not be used on non-method functions] What it does Checks for non-method functions decorated with @singledispatchmethod. Why is this bad? The @singledispatchmethod decorator is intended for use with methods, not functions. Instead, use the @singledispatch decorator. Example from functools import singledispatchmethod @singledispatchmethod def func(arg): ... Use instead: from functools import singledispatch @singledispatch def func(arg): ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as migrating from @singledispatchmethod to @singledispatch may change the behavior of the code.",
