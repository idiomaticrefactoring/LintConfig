  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: shebang-not-first-line] [Message: Shebang should be at the beginning of the file] What it does Checks for a shebang directive that is not at the beginning of the file. Why is this bad? In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. The shebang's #! prefix must be the first two characters of a file. If the shebang is not at the beginning of the file, it will be ignored, which is likely a mistake. Example foo = 1 #!/usr/bin/env python3 Use instead: #!/usr/bin/env python3 foo = 1",
