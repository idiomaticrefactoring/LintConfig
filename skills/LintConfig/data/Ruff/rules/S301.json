  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-pickle-usage] [Message: <code>pickle</code> and modules that wrap it can be unsafe when used to deserialize untrusted data, possible security issue] What it does Checks for calls to pickle functions or modules that wrap them. Why is this bad? Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior. Avoid deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules. Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON. If you must deserialize untrusted data with pickle, consider signing the data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing the payload, This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary objects into the serialized data. In preview, this rule will also flag references to pickle functions. Example import pickle with open(\"foo.pickle\", \"rb\") as file: foo = pickle.load(file) Use instead: import json with open(\"foo.json\", \"rb\") as file: foo = json.load(file)",
