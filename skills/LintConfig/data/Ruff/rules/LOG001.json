  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: direct-logger-instantiation] [Message: Use <code>logging.getLogger()</code> to instantiate loggers] What it does Checks for direct instantiation of logging.Logger, as opposed to using logging.getLogger(). Why is this bad? The Logger Objects documentation states that: Note that Loggers should NEVER be instantiated directly, but always through the module-level function logging.getLogger(name). If a logger is directly instantiated, it won't be added to the logger tree, and will bypass all configuration. Messages logged to it will only be sent to the \"handler of last resort\", skipping any filtering or formatting. Example import logging logger = logging.Logger(__name__) Use instead: import logging logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) Fix safety This fix is always unsafe, as changing from Logger to getLogger changes program behavior by will adding the logger to the logging tree.",
