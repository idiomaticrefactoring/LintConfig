  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-read-table] [Message: Use <code>.read_csv</code> instead of <code>.read_table</code> to read CSV files] What it does Checks for uses of pd.read_table to read CSV files. Why is this bad? In the Pandas API, pd.read_csv and pd.read_table are equivalent apart from their default separator: pd.read_csv defaults to a comma (,), while pd.read_table defaults to a tab (\\t) as the default separator. Prefer pd.read_csv over pd.read_table when reading comma-separated data (like CSV files), as it is more idiomatic. Example import pandas as pd cities_df = pd.read_table(\"cities.csv\", sep=\",\") Use instead: import pandas as pd cities_df = pd.read_csv(\"cities.csv\")",
