Why is this bad? When working with dictionaries, the get can be used to access a value without having to check if the dictionary contains the relevant key, returning None if the key is not present. Example if \"key\" in dct and dct[\"key\"]: ... Use instead: if dct.get(\"key\"): ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.",
