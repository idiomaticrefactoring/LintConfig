  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: request-with-no-cert-validation] [Message: Probable use of <code>{string}</code> call with <code>verify=False</code> disabling SSL certificate checks] What it does Checks for HTTPS requests that disable SSL certificate checks. Why is this bad? If SSL certificates are not verified, an attacker could perform a \"man in the middle\" attack by intercepting and modifying traffic between the client and server. Example import requests requests.get(\"https://www.example.com\", verify=False) Use instead: import requests requests.get(\"https://www.example.com\") # By default, `verify=True`.",
