  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-map] [Message: Unnecessary <code>map()</code> usage (rewrite using a {object_type})] What it does Checks for unnecessary map() calls with lambda functions. Why is this bad? Using map(func, iterable) when func is a lambda is slower than using a generator expression or a comprehension, as the latter approach avoids the function call overhead, in addition to being more readable. This rule also applies to map() calls within list(), set(), and dict() calls. For example: Instead of list(map(lambda num: num * 2, nums)), use [num * 2 for num in nums]. Instead of set(map(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, nums)), use {num % 2 == 0 for num in nums}. Instead of dict(map(lambda v: (v, v ** 2), values)), use {v: v ** 2 for v in values}. Example map(lambda x: x + 1, iterable) Use instead: (x + 1 for x in iterable) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
