  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-list-index-lookup] [Message: List index lookup in <code>enumerate()</code> loop] What it does Checks for index-based list accesses during enumerate iterations. Why is this bad? When iterating over a list with enumerate, the current item is already available alongside its index. Using the index to look up the item is unnecessary. Example letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] for index, letter in enumerate(letters): print(letters[index]) Use instead: letters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] for index, letter in enumerate(letters): print(letter)",
