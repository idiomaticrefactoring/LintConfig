  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: boolean-default-value-positional-argument] [Message: Boolean default positional argument in function definition] What it does Checks for the use of boolean positional arguments in function definitions, as determined by the presence of a boolean default value. Why is this bad? Calling a function with boolean positional arguments is confusing as the meaning of the boolean value is not clear to the caller and to future readers of the code. The use of a boolean will also limit the function to only two possible behaviors, which makes the function difficult to extend in the future. Instead, consider refactoring into separate implementations for the True and False cases, using an Enum, or making the argument a keyword-only argument, to force callers to be explicit when providing the argument. This rule exempts methods decorated with @typing.override, since changing the signature of a subclass method that overrides a superclass method may cause type checkers to complain about a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle. Example from math import ceil, floor def round_number(number, up=True): return ceil(number) if up else floor(number) round_number(1.5, True) # What does `True` mean? round_number(1.5, False) # What does `False` mean? Instead, refactor into separate implementations: from math import ceil, floor def round_up(number): return ceil(number) def round_down(number): return floor(number) round_up(1.5) round_down(1.5) Or, refactor to use an Enum: from enum import Enum class RoundingMethod(Enum): UP = 1 DOWN = 2 def round_number(value, method): return ceil(number) if method is RoundingMethod.UP else floor(number) round_number(1.5, RoundingMethod.UP) round_number(1.5, RoundingMethod.DOWN) Or, make the argument a keyword-only argument: from math import ceil, floor def round_number(number, *, up=True): return ceil(number) if up else floor(number) round_number(1.5, up=True) round_number(1.5, up=False)",
