  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redeclared-assigned-name] [Message: Redeclared variable <code>{name}</code> in assignment] What it does Checks for declared assignments to the same variable multiple times in the same assignment. Why is this bad? Assigning a variable multiple times in the same assignment is redundant, as the final assignment to the variable is what the value will be. Example a, b, a = (1, 2, 3) print(a) # 3 Use instead: # this is assuming you want to assign 3 to `a` _, b, a = (1, 2, 3) print(a) # 3",
