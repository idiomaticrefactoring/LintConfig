  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: verbose-log-message] [Message: Redundant exception object included in <code>logging.exception</code> call] What it does Checks for excessive logging of exception objects. Why is this bad? When logging exceptions via logging.exception, the exception object is logged automatically. Including the exception object in the log message is redundant and can lead to excessive logging. Example try: ... except ValueError as e: logger.exception(f\"Found an error: {e}\") Use instead: try: ... except ValueError: logger.exception(\"Found an error\")",
