  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-tuple-in-exception-handler] [Message: A length-one tuple literal is redundant in exception handlers] What it does Checks for single-element tuples in exception handlers (e.g., except (ValueError,):). Note: Single-element tuples consisting of a starred expression are allowed. Why is this bad? A tuple with a single element can be more concisely and idiomatically expressed as a single value. Example try: ... except (ValueError,): ... Use instead: try: ... except ValueError: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the exception handler contains comments.",
