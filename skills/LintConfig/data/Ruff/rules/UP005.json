  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: deprecated-unittest-alias] [Message: <code>{alias}</code> is deprecated, use <code>{target}</code>] What it does Checks for uses of deprecated methods from the unittest module. Why is this bad? The unittest module has deprecated aliases for some of its methods. The deprecated aliases were removed in Python 3.12. Instead of aliases, use their non-deprecated counterparts. Example from unittest import TestCase class SomeTest(TestCase): def test_something(self): self.assertEquals(1, 1) Use instead: from unittest import TestCase class SomeTest(TestCase): def test_something(self): self.assertEqual(1, 1)",
