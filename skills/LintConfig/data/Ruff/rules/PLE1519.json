  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: singledispatch-method] [Message: <code>@singledispatch</code> decorator should not be used on methods] What it does Checks for methods decorated with @singledispatch. Why is this bad? The @singledispatch decorator is intended for use with functions, not methods. Instead, use the @singledispatchmethod decorator, or migrate the method to a standalone function. Example from functools import singledispatch class Class: @singledispatch def method(self, arg): ... Use instead: from functools import singledispatchmethod class Class: @singledispatchmethod def method(self, arg): ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as migrating from @singledispatch to @singledispatchmethod may change the behavior of the code.",
