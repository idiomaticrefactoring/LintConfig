  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: raise-literal] [Message: Cannot raise a literal. Did you intend to return it or raise an Exception?] What it does Checks for raise statements that raise a literal value. Why is this bad? raise must be followed by an exception instance or an exception class, and exceptions must be instances of BaseException or a subclass thereof. Raising a literal will raise a TypeError at runtime. Example raise \"foo\" Use instead: raise Exception(\"foo\")",
