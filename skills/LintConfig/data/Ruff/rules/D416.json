  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-section-name-colon] [Message: Section name should end with a colon (\"{name}\")] What it does Checks for docstring section headers that do not end with a colon. Why is this bad? This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline Google-style docstrings. If a multiline Google-style docstring consists of multiple sections, each section header should end with a colon. Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header and a section body. This rule is enabled when using the google convention, and disabled when using the pep257 and numpy conventions. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns Speed as distance divided by time. Raises FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
