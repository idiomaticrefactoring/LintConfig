  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: import-shadowed-by-loop-var] [Message: Import <code>{name}</code> from {row} shadowed by loop variable] What it does Checks for import bindings that are shadowed by loop variables. Why is this bad? Shadowing an import with loop variables makes the code harder to read and reason about, as the identify of the imported binding is no longer clear. It's also often indicative of a mistake, as it's unlikely that the loop variable is intended to be used as the imported binding. Consider using a different name for the loop variable. Example from os import path for path in files: print(path) Use instead: from os import path for filename in files: print(filename)",
