  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: check-and-remove-from-set] [Message: Use <code>{suggestion}</code> instead of check and <code>remove</code>] What it does Checks for uses of set.remove that can be replaced with set.discard. Why is this bad? If an element should be removed from a set if it is present, it is more succinct and idiomatic to use discard. Known problems This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations, as it will only detect sets that are instantiated as literals or annotated with a type annotation. Example nums = {123, 456} if 123 in nums: nums.remove(123) Use instead: nums = {123, 456} nums.discard(123)",
