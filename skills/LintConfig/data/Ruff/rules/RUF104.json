  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: unmatched-suppression-comment] [Message: Suppression comment without matching <code>#ruff:enable</code> comment] What it does Checks for unmatched range suppression comments Why is this bad? Unmatched range suppression comments can inadvertently suppress violations over larger sections of code than intended, particularly at module scope. Example def foo(): # ruff: disable[E501] # unmatched REALLY_LONG_VALUES = [...] print(REALLY_LONG_VALUES) Use instead: def foo(): # ruff: disable[E501] REALLY_LONG_VALUES = [...] # ruff: enable[E501] print(REALLY_LONG_VALUES)",
