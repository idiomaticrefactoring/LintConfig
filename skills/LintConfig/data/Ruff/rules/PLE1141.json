  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: dict-iter-missing-items] [Message: Unpacking a dictionary in iteration without calling <code>.items()</code>] What it does Checks for dictionary unpacking in a for loop without calling .items(). Why is this bad? When iterating over a dictionary in a for loop, if a dictionary is unpacked without calling .items(), it could lead to a runtime error if the keys are not a tuple of two elements. It is likely that you're looking for an iteration over (key, value) pairs which can only be achieved when calling .items(). Example data = {\"Paris\": 2_165_423, \"New York City\": 8_804_190, \"Tokyo\": 13_988_129} for city, population in data: print(f\"{city} has population {population}.\") Use instead: data = {\"Paris\": 2_165_423, \"New York City\": 8_804_190, \"Tokyo\": 13_988_129} for city, population in data.items(): print(f\"{city} has population {population}.\") Known problems If the dictionary key is a tuple, e.g.: d = {(1, 2): 3, (3, 4): 5} for x, y in d: print(x, y) The tuple key is unpacked into x and y instead of the key and values. This means that the suggested fix of using d.items() would result in different runtime behavior. Ruff cannot consistently infer the type of a dictionary's keys. Fix safety Due to the known problem with tuple keys, this fix is unsafe.",
