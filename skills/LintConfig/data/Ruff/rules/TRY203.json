  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-try-except] [Message: Remove exception handler; error is immediately re-raised] What it does Checks for immediate uses of raise within exception handlers. Why is this bad? Capturing an exception, only to immediately reraise it, has no effect. Instead, remove the error-handling code and let the exception propagate upwards without the unnecessary try-except block. Example def foo(): try: bar() except NotImplementedError: raise Use instead: def foo(): bar()",
