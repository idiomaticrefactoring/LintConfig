  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-return-type-private-function] [Message: Missing return type annotation for private function <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks that private functions and methods have return type annotations. Why is this bad? Type annotations are a good way to document the return types of functions. They also help catch bugs, when used alongside a type checker, by ensuring that the types of any returned values, and the types expected by callers, match expectation. Example def _add(a, b): return a + b Use instead: def _add(a: int, b: int) -> int: return a + b Availability Because this rule relies on the third-party typing_extensions module for some Python versions, its diagnostic will not be emitted, and no fix will be offered, if typing_extensions imports have been disabled by the lint.typing-extensions linter option.",
