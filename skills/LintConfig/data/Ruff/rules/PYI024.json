  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: collections-named-tuple] [Message: Use <code>typing.NamedTuple</code> instead of <code>collections.namedtuple</code>] What it does Checks for uses of collections.namedtuple in stub files. Why is this bad? typing.NamedTuple is the \"typed version\" of collections.namedtuple. Inheriting from typing.NamedTuple creates a custom tuple subclass in the same way as using the collections.namedtuple factory function. However, using typing.NamedTuple allows you to provide a type annotation for each field in the class. This means that type checkers will have more information to work with, and will be able to analyze your code more precisely. Example from collections import namedtuple Person = namedtuple(\"Person\", [\"name\", \"age\"]) Use instead: from typing import NamedTuple class Person(NamedTuple): name: str age: int",
