  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: type-comparison] [Message: Use <code>is</code> and <code>is not</code> for type comparisons, or <code>isinstance()</code> for isinstance checks] What it does Checks for object type comparisons using == and other comparison operators. Why is this bad? Unlike a direct type comparison, isinstance will also check if an object is an instance of a class or a subclass thereof. If you want to check for an exact type match, use is or is not. Known problems When using libraries that override the == (__eq__) operator (such as NumPy, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy), this rule may produce false positives, as converting from == to is or is not will change the behavior of the code. For example, the following operations are not equivalent: import numpy as np np.array([True, False]) == False # array([False, True]) np.array([True, False]) is False # False Example if type(obj) == type(1): pass if type(obj) == int: pass Use instead: if isinstance(obj, int): pass",
