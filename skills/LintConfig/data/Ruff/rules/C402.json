  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-generator-dict] [Message: Unnecessary generator (rewrite as a dict comprehension)] What it does Checks for unnecessary generators that can be rewritten as dict comprehensions. Why is this bad? It is unnecessary to use dict() around a generator expression, since there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. Using a comprehension is clearer and more idiomatic. Example dict((x, f(x)) for x in foo) Use instead: {x: f(x) for x in foo} Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
