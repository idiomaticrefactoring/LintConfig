Why is this bad? A TypeError will be raised if the statement is run. Example import logging try: function() except Exception as e: logging.error(\"Error occurred: %s\", type(e), e) raise Use instead: import logging try: function() except Exception as e: logging.error(\"%s error occurred: %s\", type(e), e) raise",
