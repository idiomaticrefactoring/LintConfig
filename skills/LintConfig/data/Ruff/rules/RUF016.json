  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-index-type] [Message: Slice in indexed access to type <code>{value_type}</code> uses type <code>{index_type}</code> instead of an integer] What it does Checks for indexed access to lists, strings, tuples, bytes, and comprehensions using a type other than an integer or slice. Why is this bad? Only integers or slices can be used as indices to these types. Using other types will result in a TypeError at runtime and a SyntaxWarning at import time. Example var = [1, 2, 3][\"x\"] Use instead: var = [1, 2, 3][0]",
