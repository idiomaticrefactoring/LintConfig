  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: long-sleep-not-forever] [Message: <code>{module}.sleep()</code> with >24 hour interval should usually be <code>{module}.sleep_forever()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of trio.sleep() or anyio.sleep() with a delay greater than 24 hours. Why is this bad? Calling sleep() with a delay greater than 24 hours is usually intended to sleep indefinitely. Instead of using a large delay, trio.sleep_forever() or anyio.sleep_forever() better conveys the intent. Example import trio async def func(): await trio.sleep(86401) Use instead: import trio async def func(): await trio.sleep_forever() Fix safety This fix is marked as unsafe as it changes program behavior.",
