  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: start-process-with-no-shell] [Message: Starting a process without a shell] What it does Checks for functions that start a process without a shell. Why is this bad? Invoking any kind of external executable via a function call can pose security risks if arbitrary variables are passed to the executable, or if the input is otherwise unsanitised or unvalidated. This rule specifically flags functions in the os module that spawn subprocesses without the use of a shell. Note that these typically pose a much smaller security risk than subprocesses that are started with a shell, which are flagged by start-process-with-a-shell (S605). This gives you the option of enabling one rule while disabling the other if you decide that the security risk from these functions is acceptable for your use case. Example import os def insecure_function(arbitrary_user_input: str): os.spawnlp(os.P_NOWAIT, \"/bin/mycmd\", \"mycmd\", arbitrary_user_input)",
