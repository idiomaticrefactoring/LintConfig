  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-return-none] [Message: Do not explicitly <code>return None</code> in function if it is the only possible return value] What it does Checks for the presence of a return None statement when None is the only possible return value. Why is this bad? Python implicitly assumes return None if an explicit return value is omitted. Therefore, explicitly returning None is redundant and should be avoided when it is the only possible return value across all code paths in a given function. Example def foo(bar): if not bar: return return None Use instead: def foo(bar): if not bar: return return Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for cases in which comments would be dropped from the return statement.",
