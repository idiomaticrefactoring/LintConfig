  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: verbose-raise] [Message: Use <code>raise</code> without specifying exception name] What it does Checks for needless exception names in raise statements. Why is this bad? It's redundant to specify the exception name in a raise statement if the exception is being re-raised. Example def foo(): try: ... except ValueError as exc: raise exc Use instead: def foo(): try: ... except ValueError: raise Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it doesn't properly handle bound exceptions that are shadowed between the except and raise statements.",
