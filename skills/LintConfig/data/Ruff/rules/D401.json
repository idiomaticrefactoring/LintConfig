  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: non-imperative-mood] [Message: First line of docstring should be in imperative mood: \"{first_line}\"] What it does Checks for docstring first lines that are not in an imperative mood. Why is this bad? PEP 257 recommends that the first line of a docstring be written in the imperative mood, for consistency. Hint: to rewrite the docstring in the imperative, phrase the first line as if it were a command. This rule may not apply to all projects; its applicability is a matter of convention. By default, this rule is enabled when using the numpy and pep257 conventions, and disabled when using the google conventions. Example def average(values: list[float]) -> float: \"\"\"Returns the mean of the given values.\"\"\" Use instead: def average(values: list[float]) -> float: \"\"\"Return the mean of the given values.\"\"\"",
