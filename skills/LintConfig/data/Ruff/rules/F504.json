  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: percent-format-extra-named-arguments] [Message: <code>%</code>-format string has unused named argument(s): {message}] What it does Checks for unused mapping keys in printf-style format strings. Why is this bad? Unused named placeholders in printf-style format strings are unnecessary, and likely indicative of a mistake. They should be removed. Example \"Hello, %(name)s\" % {\"greeting\": \"Hello\", \"name\": \"World\"} Use instead: \"Hello, %(name)s\" % {\"name\": \"World\"} Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for mapping key containing function calls with potential side effects, because removing such arguments could change the behavior of the code. For example, the fix would be marked as unsafe in the following case: \"Hello, %(name)s\" % {\"greeting\": print(1), \"name\": \"World\"}",
