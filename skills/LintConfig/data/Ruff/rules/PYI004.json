  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: patch-version-comparison] [Message: Version comparison must use only major and minor version] What it does Checks for Python version comparisons in stubs that compare against patch versions (e.g., Python 3.8.3) instead of major and minor versions (e.g., Python 3.8). Why is this bad? Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python versions and platforms. However, type checkers only understand a limited subset of these conditionals. In particular, type checkers don't support patch versions (e.g., Python 3.8.3), only major and minor versions (e.g., Python 3.8). Therefore, version checks in stubs should only use the major and minor versions. Example import sys if sys.version_info >= (3, 4, 3): ... Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info >= (3, 4): ...",
