  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-ix] [Message: <code>.ix</code> is deprecated; use more explicit <code>.loc</code> or <code>.iloc</code>] What it does Checks for uses of .ix on Pandas objects. Why is this bad? The .ix method is deprecated as its behavior is ambiguous. Specifically, it's often unclear whether .ix is indexing by label or by ordinal position. Instead, prefer the .loc method for label-based indexing, and .iloc for ordinal indexing. Example import pandas as pd students_df = pd.read_csv(\"students.csv\") students_df.ix[0] # 0th row or row with label 0? Use instead: import pandas as pd students_df = pd.read_csv(\"students.csv\") students_df.iloc[0] # 0th row.",
