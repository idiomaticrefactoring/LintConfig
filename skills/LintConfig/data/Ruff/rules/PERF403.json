  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: manual-dict-comprehension] [Message: Use a dictionary comprehension instead of {modifier} for-loop] What it does Checks for for loops that can be replaced by a dictionary comprehension. Why is this bad? When creating or extending a dictionary in a for-loop, prefer a dictionary comprehension. Comprehensions are more readable and more performant. For example, when comparing {x: x for x in list(range(1000))} to the for loop version, the comprehension is ~10% faster on Python 3.11. Note that, as with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in most cases. Example pairs = ((\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2)) result = {} for x, y in pairs: if y % 2: result[x] = y Use instead: pairs = ((\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2)) result = {x: y for x, y in pairs if y % 2} If you're appending to an existing dictionary, use the update method instead: pairs = ((\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2)) result.update({x: y for x, y in pairs if y % 2})",
