  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assert-false] [Message: Do not <code>assert False</code> (<code>python -O</code> removes these calls), raise <code>AssertionError()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of assert False. Why is this bad? Python removes assert statements when running in optimized mode (python -O), making assert False an unreliable means of raising an AssertionError. Instead, raise an AssertionError directly. Example assert False Use instead: raise AssertionError Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as changing an assert to a raise will change the behavior of your program when running in optimized mode (python -O).",
