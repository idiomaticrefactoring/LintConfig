  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: unnecessary-from-float] [Message: Verbose method <code>{method_name}</code> in <code>{constructor}</code> construction] What it does Checks for unnecessary from_float and from_decimal usages to construct Decimal and Fraction instances. Why is this bad? Since Python 3.2, the Fraction and Decimal classes can be constructed by passing float or decimal instances to the constructor directly. As such, the use of from_float and from_decimal methods is unnecessary, and should be avoided in favor of the more concise constructor syntax. However, there are important behavioral differences between the from_* methods and the constructors: The from_* methods validate their argument types and raise TypeError for invalid types The constructors accept broader argument types without validation The from_* methods have different parameter names than the constructors Example from decimal import Decimal from fractions import Fraction Decimal.from_float(4.2) Decimal.from_float(float(\"inf\")) Fraction.from_float(4.2) Fraction.from_decimal(Decimal(\"4.2\")) Use instead: from decimal import Decimal from fractions import Fraction Decimal(4.2) Decimal(\"inf\") Fraction(4.2) Fraction(Decimal(\"4.2\")) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe by default because: The from_* methods provide type validation that the constructors don't Removing type validation can change program behavior The parameter names are different between methods and constructors The fix may remove comments attached to the original expression The fix is marked as safe only when: The argument type is known to be valid for the target constructor No keyword arguments are used, or they match the constructor's parameters",
