  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: needless-bool] [Message: Return the condition <code>{condition}</code> directly] What it does Checks for if statements that can be replaced with bool. Why is this bad? if statements that return True for a truthy condition and False for a falsy condition can be replaced with boolean casts. Example Given: def foo(x: int) -> bool: if x > 0: return True else: return False Use instead: def foo(x: int) -> bool: return x > 0 Or, given: def foo(x: int) -> bool: if x > 0: return True return False Use instead: def foo(x: int) -> bool: return x > 0 Fix safety This fix is marked as unsafe because it may change the program’s behavior if the condition does not return a proper Boolean. While the fix will try to wrap non-boolean values in a call to bool, custom implementations of comparison functions like __eq__ can avoid the bool call and still lead to altered behavior.",
