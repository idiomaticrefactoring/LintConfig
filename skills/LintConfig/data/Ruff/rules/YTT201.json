  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version-info0-eq3] [Message: <code>sys.version_info[0] == 3</code> referenced (python4), use <code>&gt;=</code>] What it does Checks for equality comparisons against the major version returned by sys.version_info (e.g., sys.version_info[0] == 3 or sys.version_info[0] != 3). Why is this bad? Using sys.version_info[0] == 3 to verify that the major version is Python 3 or greater will fail if the major version number is ever incremented (e.g., to Python 4). This is likely unintended, as code that uses this comparison is likely intended to be run on Python 2, but would now run on Python 4 too. Similarly, using sys.version_info[0] != 3 to check for Python 2 will also fail if the major version number is incremented. Instead, use >= to check if the major version number is 3 or greater, or < to check if the major version number is less than 3, to future-proof the code. Example import sys if sys.version_info[0] == 3: ... else: print(\"Python 2\") # This will be printed on Python 4. Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info >= (3,): ... else: print(\"Python 2\") # This will not be printed on Python 4.",
