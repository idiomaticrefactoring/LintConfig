  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unsorted-dunder-all] [Message: <code>__all__</code> is not sorted] What it does Checks for __all__ definitions that are not ordered according to an \"isort-style\" sort. An isort-style sort orders items first according to their casing: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE names (conventionally used for global constants) come first, followed by CamelCase names (conventionally used for classes), followed by anything else. Within each category, a natural sort is used to order the elements. Why is this bad? Consistency is good. Use a common convention for __all__ to make your code more readable and idiomatic. Example import sys __all__ = [ \"b\", \"c\", \"a\", ] if sys.platform == \"win32\": __all__ += [\"z\", \"y\"] Use instead: import sys __all__ = [ \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", ] if sys.platform == \"win32\": __all__ += [\"y\", \"z\"] Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments that take up a whole line by themselves inside the __all__ definition, for example: __all__ = [ # eggy things \"duck_eggs\", \"chicken_eggs\", # hammy things \"country_ham\", \"parma_ham\", ] This is a common pattern used to delimit categories within a module's API, but it would be out of the scope of this rule to attempt to maintain these categories when alphabetically sorting the items of __all__. The fix is also marked as unsafe if there are more than two __all__ items on a single line and that line also has a trailing comment, since here it is impossible to accurately gauge which item the comment should be moved with when sorting __all__: __all__ = [ \"a\", \"c\", \"e\", # a comment \"b\", \"d\", \"f\", # a second comment ] Other than this, the rule's fix is marked as always being safe, in that it should very rarely alter the semantics of any Python code. However, note that (although it's rare) the value of __all__ could be read by code elsewhere that depends on the exact iteration order of the items in __all__, in which case this rule's fix could theoretically cause breakage.",
