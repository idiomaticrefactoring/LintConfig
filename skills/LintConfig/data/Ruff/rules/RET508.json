  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: superfluous-else-break] [Message: Unnecessary <code>{branch}</code> after <code>break</code> statement] What it does Checks for else statements with a break statement in the preceding if block. Why is this bad? The else statement is not needed, as the break statement will always break out of the loop. Removing the else will reduce nesting and make the code more readable. Example def foo(bar, baz): for i in bar: if i > baz: break else: x = 0 Use instead: def foo(bar, baz): for i in bar: if i > baz: break x = 0",
