  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: six-py3] [Message: <code>six.PY3</code> referenced (python4), use <code>not six.PY2</code>] What it does Checks for uses of six.PY3. Why is this bad? six.PY3 will evaluate to False on Python 4 and greater. This is likely unintended, and may cause code intended to run on Python 2 to run on Python 4 too. Instead, use not six.PY2 to validate that the current Python major version is not equal to 2, to future-proof the code. Example import six six.PY3 # `False` on Python 4. Use instead: import six not six.PY2 # `True` on Python 4.",
