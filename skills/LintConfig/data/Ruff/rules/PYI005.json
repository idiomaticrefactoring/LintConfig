  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: wrong-tuple-length-version-comparison] [Message: Version comparison must be against a length-{expected_length} tuple] What it does Checks for Python version comparisons that compare against a tuple of the wrong length. Why is this bad? Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python versions and platforms. When comparing against sys.version_info, avoid comparing against tuples of the wrong length, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Example import sys if sys.version_info[:2] == (3,): ... Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info[0] == 3: ...",
