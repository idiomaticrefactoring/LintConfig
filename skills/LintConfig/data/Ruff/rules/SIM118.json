  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: in-dict-keys] [Message: Use <code>key {operator} dict</code> instead of <code>key {operator} dict.keys()</code>] What it does Checks for key-existence checks against dict.keys() calls. Why is this bad? When checking for the existence of a key in a given dictionary, using key in dict is more readable and efficient than key in dict.keys(), while having the same semantics. Example key in foo.keys() Use instead: key in foo Fix safety Given key in obj.keys(), obj could be a dictionary, or it could be another type that defines a .keys() method. In the latter case, removing the .keys() attribute could lead to a runtime error. The fix is marked as safe when the type of obj is known to be a dictionary; otherwise, it is marked as unsafe.",
