  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-telnet-usage] [Message: Telnet is considered insecure. Use SSH or some other encrypted protocol.] What it does Checks for the use of Telnet-related functions. Why is this bad? Telnet is considered insecure because it does not encrypt data sent over the connection and is vulnerable to numerous attacks. Instead, consider using a more secure protocol such as SSH. In preview, this rule will also flag references to Telnet-related functions.",
