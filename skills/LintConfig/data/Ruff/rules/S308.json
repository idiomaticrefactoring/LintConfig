  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-mark-safe-usage] [Message: Use of <code>mark_safe</code> may expose cross-site scripting vulnerabilities] What it does Checks for uses of calls to django.utils.safestring.mark_safe. Why is this bad? Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. To guard against XSS attacks, Django templates assumes that data is unsafe and automatically escapes malicious strings before rending them. django.utils.safestring.mark_safe marks a string as safe for use in HTML templates, bypassing XSS protection. Its usage can be dangerous if the contents of the string are dynamically generated, because it may allow cross-site scripting attacks if the string is not properly escaped. For dynamically generated strings, consider utilizing django.utils.html.format_html. In preview, this rule will also flag references to django.utils.safestring.mark_safe. Example from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe def render_username(username): return mark_safe(f\"<i>{username}</i>\") # Dangerous if username is user-provided. Use instead: from django.utils.html import format_html def render_username(username): return format_html(\"<i>{}</i>\", username) # username is escaped.",
