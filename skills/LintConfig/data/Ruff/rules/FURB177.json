  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: implicit-cwd] [Message: Prefer <code>Path.cwd()</code> over <code>Path().resolve()</code> for current-directory lookups] What it does Checks for current-directory lookups using Path().resolve(). Why is this bad? When looking up the current directory, prefer Path.cwd() over Path().resolve(), as Path.cwd() is more explicit in its intent. Example from pathlib import Path cwd = Path().resolve() Use instead: from pathlib import Path cwd = Path.cwd()",
