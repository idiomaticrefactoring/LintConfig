  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: unnecessary-regular-expression] [Message: Plain string pattern passed to <code>re</code> function] What it does Checks for uses of the re module that can be replaced with builtin str methods. Why is this bad? Performing checks on strings directly can make the code simpler, may require less escaping, and will often be faster. Example re.sub(\"abc\", \"\", s) Use instead: s.replace(\"abc\", \"\") Details The rule reports the following calls when the first argument to the call is a plain string literal, and no additional flags are passed: re.sub re.match re.search re.fullmatch re.split For re.sub, the repl (replacement) argument must also be a string literal, not a function. For re.match, re.search, and re.fullmatch, the return value must also be used only for its truth value. Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the affected expression contains comments. Otherwise, the fix can be applied safely.",
