Why is this bad? Airflow 3.0 moved various deprecated functions, members, and other values to its providers. Even though these symbols still work fine on Airflow 3.0, they are expected to be removed in a future version. The user is suggested to install the corresponding provider and replace the original usage with the one in the provider. Example from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator def print_context(ds=None, **kwargs): print(kwargs) print(ds) print_the_context = PythonOperator( task_id=\"print_the_context\", python_callable=print_context ) Use instead: from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator def print_context(ds=None, **kwargs): print(kwargs) print(ds) print_the_context = PythonOperator( task_id=\"print_the_context\", python_callable=print_context )",
