  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: percent-format-mixed-positional-and-named] [Message: <code>%</code>-format string has mixed positional and named placeholders] What it does Checks for printf-style format strings that have mixed positional and named placeholders. Why is this bad? Python does not support mixing positional and named placeholders in printf-style format strings. The use of mixed placeholders will raise a TypeError at runtime. Example \"%s, %(name)s\" % (\"Hello\", {\"name\": \"World\"}) Use instead: \"%s, %s\" % (\"Hello\", \"World\") Or: \"%(greeting)s, %(name)s\" % {\"greeting\": \"Hello\", \"name\": \"World\"}",
