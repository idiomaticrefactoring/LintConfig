  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blocking-path-method-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not use {path_library} methods, use trio.Path or anyio.path] What it does Checks that async functions do not call blocking os.path or pathlib.Path methods. Why is this bad? Calling some os.path or pathlib.Path methods in an async function will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the operation. This negates the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead, use the methods' async equivalents from trio.Path or anyio.Path. Example import os async def func(): path = \"my_file.txt\" file_exists = os.path.exists(path) Use instead: import trio async def func(): path = trio.Path(\"my_file.txt\") file_exists = await path.exists() Non-blocking methods are OK to use: import pathlib async def func(): path = pathlib.Path(\"my_file.txt\") file_dirname = path.dirname() new_path = os.path.join(\"/tmp/src/\", path)",
