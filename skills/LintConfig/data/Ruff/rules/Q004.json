  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-escaped-quote] [Message: Unnecessary escape on inner quote character] What it does Checks for strings that include unnecessarily escaped quotes. Why is this bad? If a string contains an escaped quote that doesn't match the quote character used for the string, it's unnecessary and can be removed. Example foo = \"bar\\'s\" Use instead: foo = \"bar's\" Formatter compatibility We recommend against using this rule alongside the formatter. The formatter automatically removes unnecessary escapes, making the rule redundant.",
