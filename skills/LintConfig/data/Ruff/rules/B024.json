  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: abstract-base-class-without-abstract-method] [Message: <code>{name}</code> is an abstract base class, but it has no abstract methods or properties] What it does Checks for abstract classes without abstract methods or properties. Annotated but unassigned class variables are regarded as abstract. Why is this bad? Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces. If an abstract base class has no abstract methods or properties, you may have forgotten to add an abstract method or property to the class, or omitted an @abstractmethod decorator. If the class is not meant to be used as an interface, consider removing the ABC base class from the class definition. Example from abc import ABC from typing import ClassVar class Foo(ABC): class_var: ClassVar[str] = \"assigned\" def method(self): bar() Use instead: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod from typing import ClassVar class Foo(ABC): class_var: ClassVar[str] # unassigned @abstractmethod def method(self): bar()",
