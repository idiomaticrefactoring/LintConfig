  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-raises-with-multiple-statements] [Message: <code>pytest.raises()</code> block should contain a single simple statement] What it does Checks for pytest.raises context managers with multiple statements. This rule allows pytest.raises bodies to contain for loops with empty bodies (e.g., pass or ... statements), to test iterator behavior. Why is this bad? When a pytest.raises is used as a context manager and contains multiple statements, it can lead to the test passing when it actually should fail. A pytest.raises context manager should only contain a single simple statement that raises the expected exception. Example import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.raises(MyError): setup() func_to_test() # not executed if `setup()` raises `MyError` assert foo() # not executed Use instead: import pytest def test_foo(): setup() with pytest.raises(MyError): func_to_test() assert foo()",
