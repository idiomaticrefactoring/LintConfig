  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: trailing-comma-on-bare-tuple] [Message: Trailing comma on bare tuple prohibited] What it does Checks for the presence of trailing commas on bare (i.e., unparenthesized) tuples. Why is this bad? The presence of a misplaced comma will cause Python to interpret the value as a tuple, which can lead to unexpected behaviour. Example import json foo = json.dumps({\"bar\": 1}), Use instead: import json foo = json.dumps({\"bar\": 1}) In the event that a tuple is intended, then use instead: import json foo = (json.dumps({\"bar\": 1}),)",
