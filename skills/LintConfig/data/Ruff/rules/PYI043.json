  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: t-suffixed-type-alias] [Message: Private type alias <code>{name}</code> should not be suffixed with <code>T</code> (the <code>T</code> suffix implies that an object is a <code>TypeVar</code>)] What it does Checks for private type alias definitions suffixed with 'T'. Why is this bad? It's conventional to use the 'T' suffix for type variables; the use of such a suffix implies that the object is a TypeVar. Adding the 'T' suffix to a non-TypeVar, it can be misleading and should be avoided. Example from typing import TypeAlias _MyTypeT: TypeAlias = int Use instead: from typing import TypeAlias _MyType: TypeAlias = int",
