  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: hardcoded-bind-all-interfaces] [Message: Possible binding to all interfaces] What it does Checks for hardcoded bindings to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0). Why is this bad? Binding to all network interfaces is insecure as it allows access from unintended interfaces, which may be poorly secured or unauthorized. Instead, bind to specific interfaces. Example ALLOWED_HOSTS = [\"0.0.0.0\"] Use instead: ALLOWED_HOSTS = [\"127.0.0.1\", \"localhost\"]",
