  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: percent-format-missing-argument] [Message: <code>%</code>-format string is missing argument(s) for placeholder(s): {message}] What it does Checks for named placeholders in printf-style format strings that are not present in the provided mapping. Why is this bad? Named placeholders that lack a corresponding value in the provided mapping will raise a KeyError. Example \"%(greeting)s, %(name)s\" % {\"name\": \"world\"} Use instead: \"Hello, %(name)s\" % {\"name\": \"world\"}",
