  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: f-string-missing-placeholders] [Message: f-string without any placeholders] What it does Checks for f-strings that do not contain any placeholder expressions. Why is this bad? f-strings are a convenient way to format strings, but they are not necessary if there are no placeholder expressions to format. In this case, a regular string should be used instead, as an f-string without placeholders can be confusing for readers, who may expect such a placeholder to be present. An f-string without any placeholders could also indicate that the author forgot to add a placeholder expression. Example f\"Hello, world!\" Use instead: \"Hello, world!\" Note: to maintain compatibility with PyFlakes, this rule only flags f-strings that are part of an implicit concatenation if none of the f-string segments contain placeholder expressions. For example: # Will not be flagged. ( f\"Hello,\" f\" {name}!\" ) # Will be flagged. ( f\"Hello,\" f\" World!\" ) See #10885 for more.",
