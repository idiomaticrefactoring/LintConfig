  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unix-command-wildcard-injection] [Message: Possible wildcard injection in call due to <code>*</code> usage] What it does Checks for possible wildcard injections in calls to subprocess.Popen(). Why is this bad? Wildcard injections can lead to unexpected behavior if unintended files are matched by the wildcard. Consider using a more specific path instead. Example import subprocess subprocess.Popen([\"chmod\", \"777\", \"*.py\"], shell=True) Use instead: import subprocess subprocess.Popen([\"chmod\", \"777\", \"main.py\"], shell=True)",
