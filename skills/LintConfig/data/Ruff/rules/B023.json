  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: function-uses-loop-variable] [Message: Function definition does not bind loop variable <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for function definitions that use a loop variable. Why is this bad? The loop variable is not bound in the function definition, so it will always have the value it had in the last iteration when the function is called. Instead, consider using a default argument to bind the loop variable at function definition time. Or, use functools.partial. Example adders = [lambda x: x + i for i in range(3)] values = [adder(1) for adder in adders] # [3, 3, 3] Use instead: adders = [lambda x, i=i: x + i for i in range(3)] values = [adder(1) for adder in adders] # [1, 2, 3] Or: from functools import partial adders = [partial(lambda x, i: x + i, i=i) for i in range(3)] values = [adder(1) for adder in adders] # [1, 2, 3]",
