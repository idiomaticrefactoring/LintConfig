  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: reimplemented-starmap] [Message: Use <code>itertools.starmap</code> instead of the generator] What it does Checks for generator expressions, list and set comprehensions that can be replaced with itertools.starmap. Why is this bad? When unpacking values from iterators to pass them directly to a function, prefer itertools.starmap. Using itertools.starmap is more concise and readable. Furthermore, it is more efficient than generator expressions, and in some versions of Python, it is more efficient than comprehensions. Known problems Since Python 3.12, itertools.starmap is less efficient than comprehensions (#7771). This is due to PEP 709, which made comprehensions faster. Example all(predicate(a, b) for a, b in some_iterable) Use instead: from itertools import starmap all(starmap(predicate, some_iterable)) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.",
