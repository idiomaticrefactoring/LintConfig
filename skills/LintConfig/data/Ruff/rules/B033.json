  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-value] [Message: Sets should not contain duplicate item <code>{value}</code>] What it does Checks for set literals that contain duplicate items. Why is this bad? In Python, sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Including a duplicate item in a set literal is redundant, as the duplicate item will be replaced with a single item at runtime. Example {1, 2, 3, 1} Use instead: {1, 2, 3} Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression, potentially losing important context or documentation. For example: { 1, 2, # Comment 1, }",
