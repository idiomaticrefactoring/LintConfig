  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: line-contains-hack] [Message: Line contains HACK, consider resolving the issue] What it does Checks for \"HACK\" comments. Why is this bad? \"HACK\" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved (usually, a suboptimal solution or temporary workaround). Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code. Note that if you use \"HACK\" comments as a form of documentation, this rule may not be appropriate for your project. Example import os def running_windows(): # HACK: Use platform module instead. try: os.mkdir(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\") except FileExistsError: return True else: os.rmdir(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\\") return False",
