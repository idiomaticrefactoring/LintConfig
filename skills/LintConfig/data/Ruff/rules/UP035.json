  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: deprecated-import] [Message: Import from <code>{target}</code> instead: {names}] What it does Checks for uses of deprecated imports based on the minimum supported Python version. Why is this bad? Deprecated imports may be removed in future versions of Python, and should be replaced with their new equivalents. Note that, in some cases, it may be preferable to continue importing members from typing_extensions even after they're added to the Python standard library, as typing_extensions can backport bugfixes and optimizations from later Python versions. This rule thus avoids flagging imports from typing_extensions in such cases. Example from collections import Sequence Use instead: from collections.abc import Sequence",
