  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: docstring-missing-yields] [Message: <code>yield</code> is not documented in docstring] What it does Checks for functions with yield statements that do not have \"Yields\" sections in their docstrings. Why is this bad? A missing \"Yields\" section is a sign of incomplete documentation. This rule is not enforced for abstract methods or functions that only yield None. It is also ignored for \"stub functions\": functions where the body only consists of pass, ..., raise NotImplementedError, or similar. Example def count_to_n(n: int) -> int: \"\"\"Generate integers up to *n*. Args: n: The number at which to stop counting. \"\"\" for i in range(1, n + 1): yield i Use instead: def count_to_n(n: int) -> int: \"\"\"Generate integers up to *n*. Args: n: The number at which to stop counting. Yields: int: The number we're at in the count. \"\"\" for i in range(1, n + 1): yield i",
