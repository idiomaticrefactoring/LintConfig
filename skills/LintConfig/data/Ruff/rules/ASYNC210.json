  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: blocking-http-call-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not call blocking HTTP methods] What it does Checks that async functions do not contain blocking HTTP calls. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking HTTP call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the HTTP response, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of making a blocking HTTP call, use an asynchronous HTTP client library such as aiohttp or httpx. Example import urllib async def fetch(): urllib.request.urlopen(\"https://example.com/foo/bar\").read() Use instead: import aiohttp async def fetch(): async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session: async with session.get(\"https://example.com/foo/bar\") as resp: ...",
