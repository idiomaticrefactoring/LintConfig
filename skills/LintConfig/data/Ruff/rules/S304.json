  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-insecure-cipher-usage] [Message: Use of insecure cipher, replace with a known secure cipher such as AES] What it does Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic ciphers. Why is this bad? Weak or broken cryptographic ciphers may be susceptible to attacks that allow an attacker to decrypt ciphertext without knowing the key or otherwise compromise the security of the cipher, such as forgeries. Use strong, modern cryptographic ciphers instead of weak or broken ones. In preview, this rule will also flag references to insecure ciphers. Example from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms algorithm = algorithms.ARC4(key) cipher = Cipher(algorithm, mode=None) encryptor = cipher.encryptor() Use instead: from cryptography.fernet import Fernet fernet = Fernet(key)",
