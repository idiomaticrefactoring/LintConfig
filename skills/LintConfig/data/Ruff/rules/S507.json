  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: ssh-no-host-key-verification] [Message: Paramiko call with policy set to automatically trust the unknown host key] What it does Checks for uses of policies disabling SSH verification in Paramiko. Why is this bad? By default, Paramiko checks the identity of the remote host when establishing an SSH connection. Disabling the verification might lead to the client connecting to a malicious host, without the client knowing. Example from paramiko import client ssh_client = client.SSHClient() ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(client.AutoAddPolicy) Use instead: from paramiko import client ssh_client = client.SSHClient() ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(client.RejectPolicy)",
