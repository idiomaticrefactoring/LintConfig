  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: nonlocal-without-binding] [Message: Nonlocal name <code>{name}</code> found without binding] What it does Checks for nonlocal names without bindings. Why is this bad? nonlocal names must be bound to a name in an outer scope. Violating this rule leads to a SyntaxError at runtime. Example def foo(): def get_bar(self): nonlocal bar ... Use instead: def foo(): bar = 1 def get_bar(self): nonlocal bar ...",
