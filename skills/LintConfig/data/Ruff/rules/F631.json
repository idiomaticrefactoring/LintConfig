  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assert-tuple] [Message: Assert test is a non-empty tuple, which is always <code>True</code>] What it does Checks for assert statements that use non-empty tuples as test conditions. Why is this bad? Non-empty tuples are always True, so an assert statement with a non-empty tuple as its test condition will always pass. This is likely a mistake. Example assert (some_condition,) Use instead: assert some_condition",
