  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-literal-union] [Message: <code>Literal[{literal}]</code> is redundant in a union with <code>{builtin_type}</code>] What it does Checks for redundant unions between a Literal and a builtin supertype of that Literal. Why is this bad? Using a Literal type in a union with its builtin supertype is redundant, as the supertype will be strictly more general than the Literal type. For example, Literal[\"A\"] | str is equivalent to str, and Literal[1] | int is equivalent to int, as str and int are the supertypes of \"A\" and 1 respectively. Example from typing import Literal x: Literal[\"A\", b\"B\"] | str Use instead: from typing import Literal x: Literal[b\"B\"] | str",
