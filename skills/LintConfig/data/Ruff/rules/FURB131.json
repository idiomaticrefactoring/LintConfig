  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: delete-full-slice] [Message: Prefer <code>clear</code> over deleting a full slice] What it does Checks for del statements that delete the entire slice of a list or dictionary. Why is this bad? It is faster and more succinct to remove all items via the clear() method. Known problems This rule is prone to false negatives due to type inference limitations, as it will only detect lists and dictionaries that are instantiated as literals or annotated with a type annotation. Example names = {\"key\": \"value\"} nums = [1, 2, 3] del names[:] del nums[:] Use instead: names = {\"key\": \"value\"} nums = [1, 2, 3] names.clear() nums.clear()",
