  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-index-return-type] [Message: <code>__index__</code> does not return an integer] What it does Checks for __index__ implementations that return non-integer values. Why is this bad? The __index__ method should return an integer. Returning a different type may cause unexpected behavior. Note: bool is a subclass of int, so it's technically valid for __index__ to return True or False. However, a DeprecationWarning (DeprecationWarning: __index__ returned non-int (type bool)) for such cases was already introduced, thus this is a conscious difference between the original pylint rule and the current ruff implementation. Example class Foo: def __index__(self): return \"2\" Use instead: class Foo: def __index__(self): return 2",
