  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-todo-capitalization] [Message: Invalid TODO capitalization: <code>{tag}</code> should be <code>TODO</code>] What it does Checks that a \"TODO\" tag is properly capitalized (i.e., that the tag is uppercase). Why is this bad? Capitalizing the \"TODO\" in a TODO comment is a convention that makes it easier for future readers to identify TODOs. Example # todo(charlie): capitalize this Use instead: # TODO(charlie): this is capitalized",
