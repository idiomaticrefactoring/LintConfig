  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: if-expr-with-true-false] [Message: Remove unnecessary <code>True if ... else False</code>] What it does Checks for if expressions that can be replaced with bool() calls. Why is this bad? if expressions that evaluate to True for a truthy condition an False for a falsey condition can be replaced with bool() calls, which are more concise and readable. Example True if a else False Use instead: bool(a) Fix safety This fix is marked as unsafe because it may change the program’s behavior if the condition does not return a proper Boolean. While the fix will try to wrap non-boolean values in a call to bool, custom implementations of comparison functions like __eq__ can avoid the bool call and still lead to altered behavior. Moreover, the fix may remove comments.",
