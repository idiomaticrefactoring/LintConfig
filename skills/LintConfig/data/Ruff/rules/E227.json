  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: missing-whitespace-around-bitwise-or-shift-operator] [Message: Missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator] What it does Checks for missing whitespace around bitwise and shift operators. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends never using more than one space, and always having the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator. For consistency, this rule enforces one space before and after bitwise and shift operators (<<, >>, &, |, ^). (Note that PEP 8 suggests only adding whitespace around the operator with the lowest precedence, but that authors should \"use [their] own judgment\".) Example x = 128<<1 Use instead: x = 128 << 1",
