  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: bare-except] [Message: Do not use bare <code>except</code>] What it does Checks for bare except catches in try-except statements. Why is this bad? A bare except catches BaseException which includes KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit, Exception, and others. Catching BaseException can make it hard to interrupt the program (e.g., with Ctrl-C) and can disguise other problems. Example try: raise KeyboardInterrupt(\"You probably don't mean to break CTRL-C.\") except: print(\"But a bare `except` will ignore keyboard interrupts.\") Use instead: try: do_something_that_might_break() except MoreSpecificException as e: handle_error(e) If you actually need to catch an unknown error, use Exception which will catch regular program errors but not important system exceptions. def run_a_function(some_other_fn): try: some_other_fn() except Exception as e: print(f\"How exceptional! {e}\")",
