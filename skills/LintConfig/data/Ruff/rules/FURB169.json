  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: type-none-comparison] [Message: When checking against <code>None</code>, use <code>{}</code> instead of comparison with <code>type(None)</code>] What it does Checks for uses of type that compare the type of an object to the type of None. Why is this bad? There is only ever one instance of None, so it is more efficient and readable to use the is operator to check if an object is None. Example type(obj) is type(None) Use instead: obj is None Fix safety If the fix might remove comments, it will be marked as unsafe.",
