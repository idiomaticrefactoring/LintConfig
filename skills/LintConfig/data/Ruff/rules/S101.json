  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assert] [Message: Use of <code>assert</code> detected] What it does Checks for uses of the assert keyword. Why is this bad? Assertions are removed when Python is run with optimization requested (i.e., when the -O flag is present), which is a common practice in production environments. As such, assertions should not be used for runtime validation of user input or to enforce interface constraints. Consider raising a meaningful error instead of using assert. Example assert x > 0, \"Expected positive value.\" Use instead: if not x > 0: raise ValueError(\"Expected positive value.\") # or even better: if x <= 0: raise ValueError(\"Expected positive value.\")",
