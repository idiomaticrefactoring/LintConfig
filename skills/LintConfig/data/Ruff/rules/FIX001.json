  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: line-contains-fixme] [Message: Line contains FIXME, consider resolving the issue] What it does Checks for \"FIXME\" comments. Why is this bad? \"FIXME\" comments are used to describe an issue that should be resolved (usually, a bug or unexpected behavior). Consider resolving the issue before deploying the code. Note that if you use \"FIXME\" comments as a form of documentation, this rule may not be appropriate for your project. Example def speed(distance, time): return distance / time # FIXME: Raises ZeroDivisionError for time = 0.",
