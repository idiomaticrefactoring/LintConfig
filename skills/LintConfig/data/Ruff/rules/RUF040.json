  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-assert-message-literal-argument] [Message: Non-string literal used as assert message] What it does Checks for invalid use of literals in assert message arguments. Why is this bad? An assert message which is a non-string literal was likely intended to be used in a comparison assertion, rather than as a message. Example fruits = [\"apples\", \"plums\", \"pears\"] fruits.filter(lambda fruit: fruit.startwith(\"p\")) assert len(fruits), 2 # True unless the list is empty Use instead: fruits = [\"apples\", \"plums\", \"pears\"] fruits.filter(lambda fruit: fruit.startwith(\"p\")) assert len(fruits) == 2",
