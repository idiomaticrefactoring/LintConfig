  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: ambiguous-variable-name] [Message: Ambiguous variable name: <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for the use of the characters 'l', 'O', or 'I' as variable names. Note: This rule is automatically disabled for all stub files (files with .pyi extensions). The rule has little relevance for authors of stubs: a well-written stub should aim to faithfully represent the interface of the equivalent .py file as it exists at runtime, including any ambiguously named variables in the runtime module. Why is this bad? In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use 'l', use 'L' instead. Example l = 0 O = 123 I = 42 Use instead: L = 0 o = 123 i = 42",
