  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: convert-typed-dict-functional-to-class] [Message: Convert <code>{name}</code> from <code>TypedDict</code> functional to class syntax] What it does Checks for TypedDict declarations that use functional syntax. Why is this bad? TypedDict types can be defined either through a functional syntax (Foo = TypedDict(...)) or a class syntax (class Foo(TypedDict): ...). The class syntax is more readable and generally preferred over the functional syntax. Nonetheless, there are some situations in which it is impossible to use the class-based syntax. This rule will not apply to those cases. Namely, it is impossible to use the class-based syntax if any TypedDict fields are: Not valid python identifiers (for example, @x) Python keywords such as in Private names such as __id that would undergo name mangling at runtime if the class-based syntax was used Dunder names such as __int__ that can confuse type checkers if they're used with the class-based syntax. Example from typing import TypedDict Foo = TypedDict(\"Foo\", {\"a\": int, \"b\": str}) Use instead: from typing import TypedDict class Foo(TypedDict): a: int b: str Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if there are any comments within the range of the TypedDict definition, as these will be dropped by the autofix.",
