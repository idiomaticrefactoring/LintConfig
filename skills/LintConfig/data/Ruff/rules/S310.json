  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-url-open-usage] [Message: Audit URL open for permitted schemes. Allowing use of <code>file:</code> or custom schemes is often unexpected.] What it does Checks for instances where URL open functions are used with unexpected schemes. Why is this bad? Some URL open functions allow the use of file: or custom schemes (for use instead of http: or https:). An attacker may be able to use these schemes to access or modify unauthorized resources, and cause unexpected behavior. To mitigate this risk, audit all uses of URL open functions and ensure that only permitted schemes are used (e.g., allowing http: and https:, and disallowing file: and ftp:). In preview, this rule will also flag references to URL open functions. Example from urllib.request import urlopen url = input(\"Enter a URL: \") with urlopen(url) as response: ... Use instead: from urllib.request import urlopen url = input(\"Enter a URL: \") if not url.startswith((\"http:\", \"https:\")): raise ValueError(\"URL must start with 'http:' or 'https:'\") with urlopen(url) as response: ...",
