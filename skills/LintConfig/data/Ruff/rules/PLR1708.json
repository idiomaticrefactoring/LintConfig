  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: stop-iteration-return] [Message: Explicit <code>raise StopIteration</code> in generator] What it does Checks for explicit raise StopIteration in generator functions. Why is this bad? Raising StopIteration in a generator function causes a RuntimeError when the generator is iterated over. Instead of raise StopIteration, use return in generator functions. Example def my_generator(): yield 1 yield 2 raise StopIteration # This causes RuntimeError at runtime Use instead: def my_generator(): yield 1 yield 2 return # Use return instead",
