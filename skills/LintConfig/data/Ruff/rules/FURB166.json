  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: int-on-sliced-str] [Message: Use of <code>int</code> with explicit <code>base={base}</code> after removing prefix] What it does Checks for uses of int with an explicit base in which a string expression is stripped of its leading prefix (i.e., 0b, 0o, or 0x). Why is this bad? Given an integer string with a prefix (e.g., 0xABC), Python can automatically determine the base of the integer by the prefix without needing to specify it explicitly. Instead of int(num[2:], 16), use int(num, 0), which will automatically deduce the base based on the prefix. Example num = \"0xABC\" if num.startswith(\"0b\"): i = int(num[2:], 2) elif num.startswith(\"0o\"): i = int(num[2:], 8) elif num.startswith(\"0x\"): i = int(num[2:], 16) print(i) Use instead: num = \"0xABC\" i = int(num, 0) print(i) Fix safety The rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as Ruff cannot guarantee that the argument to int will remain valid when its base is included in the function call.",
