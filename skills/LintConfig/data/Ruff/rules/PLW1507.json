  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: shallow-copy-environ] [Message: Shallow copy of <code>os.environ</code> via <code>copy.copy(os.environ)</code>] What it does Check for shallow os.environ copies. Why is this bad? os.environ is not a dict object, but rather, a proxy object. As such, mutating a shallow copy of os.environ will also mutate the original object. See BPO 15373 for more information. Example import copy import os env = copy.copy(os.environ) Use instead: import os env = os.environ.copy() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because replacing a shallow copy with a deep copy can lead to unintended side effects. If the program modifies the shallow copy at some point, changing it to a deep copy may prevent those modifications from affecting the original data, potentially altering the program's behavior.",
