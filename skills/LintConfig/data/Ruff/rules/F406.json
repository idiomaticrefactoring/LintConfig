  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: undefined-local-with-nested-import-star-usage] [Message: <code>from {name} import *</code> only allowed at module level] What it does Check for the use of wildcard imports outside of the module namespace. Why is this bad? The use of wildcard imports outside of the module namespace (e.g., within functions) can lead to confusion, as the import can shadow local variables. Though wildcard imports are discouraged by PEP 8, when necessary, they should be placed in the module namespace (i.e., at the top-level of a module). Example def foo(): from math import * Use instead: from math import * def foo(): ...",
