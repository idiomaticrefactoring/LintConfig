  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-stack] [Message: <code>.melt</code> is preferred to <code>.stack</code>; provides same functionality] What it does Checks for uses of .stack on Pandas objects. Why is this bad? Prefer .melt to .stack, which has the same functionality but with support for direct column renaming and no dependence on MultiIndex. Example import pandas as pd cities_df = pd.read_csv(\"cities.csv\") cities_df.set_index(\"city\").stack() Use instead: import pandas as pd cities_df = pd.read_csv(\"cities.csv\") cities_df.melt(id_vars=\"city\")",
