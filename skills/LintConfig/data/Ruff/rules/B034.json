  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: re-sub-positional-args] [Message: <code>{method}</code> should pass <code>{param_name}</code> and <code>flags</code> as keyword arguments to avoid confusion due to unintuitive argument positions] What it does Checks for calls to re.sub, re.subn, and re.split that pass count, maxsplit, or flags as positional arguments. Why is this bad? Passing count, maxsplit, or flags as positional arguments to re.sub, re.subn, or re.split can lead to confusion, as most methods in the re module accept flags as the third positional argument, while re.sub, re.subn, and re.split have different signatures. Instead, pass count, maxsplit, and flags as keyword arguments. Example import re re.split(\"pattern\", \"replacement\", 1) Use instead: import re re.split(\"pattern\", \"replacement\", maxsplit=1)",
