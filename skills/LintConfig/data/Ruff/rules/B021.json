  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: f-string-docstring] [Message: f-string used as docstring. Python will interpret this as a joined string, rather than a docstring.] What it does Checks for docstrings that are written via f-strings. Why is this bad? Python will interpret the f-string as a joined string, rather than as a docstring. As such, the \"docstring\" will not be accessible via the __doc__ attribute, nor will it be picked up by any automated documentation tooling. Example def foo(): f\"\"\"Not a docstring.\"\"\" Use instead: def foo(): \"\"\"A docstring.\"\"\"",
