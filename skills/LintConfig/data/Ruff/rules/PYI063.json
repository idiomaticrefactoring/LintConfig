  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pep484-style-positional-only-parameter] [Message: Use PEP 570 syntax for positional-only parameters] What it does Checks for the presence of PEP 484-style positional-only parameters. Why is this bad? Historically, PEP 484 recommended prefixing parameter names with double underscores (__) to indicate to a type checker that they were positional-only. However, PEP 570 (introduced in Python 3.8) introduced dedicated syntax for positional-only arguments. If a forward slash (/) is present in a function signature on Python 3.8+, all parameters prior to the slash are interpreted as positional-only. The new syntax should be preferred as it is more widely used, more concise and more readable. It is also respected by Python at runtime, whereas the old-style syntax was only understood by type checkers. Example def foo(__x: int) -> None: ... Use instead: def foo(x: int, /) -> None: ...",

      "option_description": "The minimum Python version to target, e.g., when considering automatic\ncode upgrades, like rewriting type annotations. Ruff will not propose\nchanges using features that are not available in the given version.\n\nFor example, to represent supporting Python >=3.11 or ==3.11\nspecify target-version = \"py311\".\n\nIf you're already using a pyproject.toml file, we recommend\nproject.requires-python instead, as it's based on Python packaging\nstandards, and will be respected by other tools. For example, Ruff\ntreats the following as identical to target-version = \"py38\":\n\n[project]\nrequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\nIf both are specified, target-version takes precedence over\nrequires-python. See Inferring the Python version\nfor a complete description of how the target-version is determined\nwhen left unspecified.\n\nNote that a stub file can sometimes make use of a typing feature\nbefore it is available at runtime, as long as the stub does not make\nuse of new syntax. For example, a type checker will understand\nint | str in a stub as being a Union type annotation, even if the\ntype checker is run using Python 3.9, despite the fact that the |\noperator can only be used to create union types at runtime on Python\n3.10+. As such, Ruff will often recommend newer features in a stub\nfile than it would for an equivalent runtime file with the same target\nversion.\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\npyproject.tomlruff.toml\n\n\n[tool.ruff]\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"\n\n\n\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"",
