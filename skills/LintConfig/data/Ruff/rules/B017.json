  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assert-raises-exception] [Message: Do not assert blind exception: <code>{exception}</code>] What it does Checks for assertRaises and pytest.raises context managers that catch Exception or BaseException. Why is this bad? These forms catch every Exception, which can lead to tests passing even if, e.g., the code under consideration raises a SyntaxError or IndentationError. Either assert for a more specific exception (builtin or custom), or use assertRaisesRegex or pytest.raises(..., match=<REGEX>) respectively. Example self.assertRaises(Exception, foo) Use instead: self.assertRaises(SomeSpecificException, foo)",
