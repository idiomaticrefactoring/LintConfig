  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: late-future-import] [Message: <code>from __future__</code> imports must occur at the beginning of the file] What it does Checks for __future__ imports that are not located at the beginning of a file. Why is this bad? Imports from __future__ must be placed the beginning of the file, before any other statements (apart from docstrings). The use of __future__ imports elsewhere is invalid and will result in a SyntaxError. Example from pathlib import Path from __future__ import annotations Use instead: from __future__ import annotations from pathlib import Path",
