  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unused-unpacked-variable] [Message: Unpacked variable <code>{name}</code> is never used] What it does Checks for the presence of unused variables in unpacked assignments. Why is this bad? A variable that is defined but never used can confuse readers. If a variable is intentionally defined-but-not-used, it should be prefixed with an underscore, or some other value that adheres to the lint.dummy-variable-rgx pattern. Example def get_pair(): return 1, 2 def foo(): x, y = get_pair() return x Use instead: def foo(): x, _ = get_pair() return x See also This rule applies only to unpacked assignments. For regular assignments, see unused-variable.",
