  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: overindented-section] [Message: Section is over-indented (\"{name}\")] What it does Checks for over-indented sections in docstrings. Why is this bad? This rule enforces a consistent style for docstrings with multiple sections. Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header and a section body. The convention is that all sections should use consistent indentation. In each section, the header should match the indentation of the docstring's opening quotes, and the body should be indented one level further. This rule is enabled when using the numpy and google conventions, and disabled when using the pep257 convention. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: FasterThanLightError: If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
