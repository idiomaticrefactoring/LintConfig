  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: hashlib-insecure-hash-function] [Message: Probable use of insecure hash functions in <code>{library}</code>: <code>{string}</code>] What it does Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in hashlib and crypt libraries. Why is this bad? Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash) or pre-image attacks (where an attacker can find an input that produces a given hash). This can lead to security vulnerabilities in applications that rely on these hash functions. Avoid using weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in security contexts. Instead, use a known secure hash function such as SHA256. Note: This rule targets the following weak algorithm names in hashlib: md4, md5, sha, and sha1. It also flags uses of crypt.crypt and crypt.mksalt when configured with METHOD_CRYPT, METHOD_MD5, or METHOD_BLOWFISH. It does not attempt to lint OpenSSL- or platform-specific aliases and OIDs (for example: \"sha-1\", \"ssl3-sha1\", \"ssl3-md5\", or \"1.3.14.3.2.26\"), nor variations with trailing spaces, as the set of accepted aliases depends on the underlying OpenSSL version and varies across platforms and Python builds. Example import hashlib def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool: hash = hashlib.md5(certificate).hexdigest() return hash == known_hash Use instead: import hashlib def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool: hash = hashlib.sha256(certificate).hexdigest() return hash == known_hash or add usedforsecurity=False if the hashing algorithm is not used in a security context, e.g. as a non-cryptographic one-way compression function: import hashlib def certificate_is_valid(certificate: bytes, known_hash: str) -> bool: hash = hashlib.md5(certificate, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest() return hash == known_hash",
