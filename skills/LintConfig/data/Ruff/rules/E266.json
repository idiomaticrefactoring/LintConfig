  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: multiple-leading-hashes-for-block-comment] [Message: Too many leading <code>#</code> before block comment] What it does Checks for block comments that start with multiple leading # characters. Why is this bad? Per PEP 8, \"Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.\" Each line of a block comment should start with a # followed by a single space. Shebangs (lines starting with #!, at the top of a file) are exempt from this rule. Example ### Block comment Use instead: # Block comment Alternatively, this rule makes an exception for comments that consist solely of # characters, as in: ############## # Block header ##############",
