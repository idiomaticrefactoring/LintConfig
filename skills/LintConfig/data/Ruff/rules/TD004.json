  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: missing-todo-colon] [Message: Missing colon in TODO] What it does Checks that a \"TODO\" tag is followed by a colon. Why is this bad? \"TODO\" tags are typically followed by a parenthesized author name, a colon, a space, and a description of the issue, in that order. Deviating from this pattern can lead to inconsistent and non-idiomatic comments. Example # TODO(charlie) fix this colon Used instead: # TODO(charlie): colon fixed",
