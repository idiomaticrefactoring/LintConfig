  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: call-datetime-without-tzinfo] [Message: <code>datetime.datetime()</code> called without a <code>tzinfo</code> argument] What it does Checks for datetime instantiations that do not specify a timezone. Why is this bad? datetime objects are \"naive\" by default, in that they do not include timezone information. \"Naive\" objects are easy to understand, but ignore some aspects of reality, which can lead to subtle bugs. Timezone-aware datetime objects are preferred, as they represent a specific moment in time, unlike \"naive\" objects. By providing a non-None value for tzinfo, a datetime can be made timezone-aware. Example import datetime datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) Use instead: import datetime datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) Or, on Python 3.11 and later: import datetime datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=datetime.UTC)",
