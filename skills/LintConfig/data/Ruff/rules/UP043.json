  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-default-type-args] [Message: Unnecessary default type arguments] What it does Checks for unnecessary default type arguments for Generator and AsyncGenerator on Python 3.13+. In preview, this rule will also apply to stub files. Why is this bad? Python 3.13 introduced the ability for type parameters to specify default values. Following this change, several standard-library classes were updated to add default values for some of their type parameters. For example, Generator[int] is now equivalent to Generator[int, None, None], as the second and third type parameters of Generator now default to None. Omitting type arguments that match the default values can make the code more concise and easier to read. Example from collections.abc import Generator, AsyncGenerator def sync_gen() -> Generator[int, None, None]: yield 42 async def async_gen() -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]: yield 42 Use instead: from collections.abc import Generator, AsyncGenerator def sync_gen() -> Generator[int]: yield 42 async def async_gen() -> AsyncGenerator[int]: yield 42 Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments.",

Ruff will not propose\nchanges using features that are not available in the given version.\n\nFor example, to represent supporting Python >=3.11 or ==3.11\nspecify target-version = \"py311\".\n\nIf you're already using a pyproject.toml file, we recommend\nproject.requires-python instead, as it's based on Python packaging\nstandards, and will be respected by other tools. For example, Ruff\ntreats the following as identical to target-version = \"py38\":\n\n[project]\nrequires-python = \">=3.8\"\n\nIf both are specified, target-version takes precedence over\nrequires-python. See Inferring the Python version\nfor a complete description of how the target-version is determined\nwhen left unspecified.\n\nNote that a stub file can sometimes make use of a typing feature\nbefore it is available at runtime, as long as the stub does not make\nuse of new syntax. For example, a type checker will understand\nint | str in a stub as being a Union type annotation, even if the\ntype checker is run using Python 3.9, despite the fact that the |\noperator can only be used to create union types at runtime on Python\n3.10+. As such, Ruff will often recommend newer features in a stub\nfile than it would for an equivalent runtime file with the same target\nversion.\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\npyproject.tomlruff.toml\n\n\n[tool.ruff]\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"\n\n\n\n# Always generate Python 3.7-compatible code.\ntarget-version = \"py37\"",
