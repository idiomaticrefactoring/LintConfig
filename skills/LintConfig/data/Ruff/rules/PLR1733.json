  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-dict-index-lookup] [Message: Unnecessary lookup of dictionary value by key] What it does Checks for key-based dict accesses during .items() iterations. Why is this bad? When iterating over a dict via .items(), the current value is already available alongside its key. Using the key to look up the value is unnecessary. Example FRUITS = {\"apple\": 1, \"orange\": 10, \"berry\": 22} for fruit_name, fruit_count in FRUITS.items(): print(FRUITS[fruit_name]) Use instead: FRUITS = {\"apple\": 1, \"orange\": 10, \"berry\": 22} for fruit_name, fruit_count in FRUITS.items(): print(fruit_count)",
