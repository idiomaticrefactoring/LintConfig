  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-insecure-cipher-mode-usage] [Message: Use of insecure block cipher mode, replace with a known secure mode such as CBC or CTR] What it does Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic cipher modes. Why is this bad? Weak or broken cryptographic ciphers may be susceptible to attacks that allow an attacker to decrypt ciphertext without knowing the key or otherwise compromise the security of the cipher, such as forgeries. Use strong, modern cryptographic ciphers instead of weak or broken ones. In preview, this rule will also flag references to insecure cipher modes. Example from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes algorithm = algorithms.ARC4(key) cipher = Cipher(algorithm, mode=modes.ECB(iv)) encryptor = cipher.encryptor() Use instead: from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes algorithm = algorithms.ARC4(key) cipher = Cipher(algorithm, mode=modes.CTR(iv)) encryptor = cipher.encryptor()",
