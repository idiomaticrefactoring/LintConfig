  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: manual-list-comprehension] [Message: Use {message_str} to create a transformed list] What it does Checks for for loops that can be replaced by a list comprehension. Why is this bad? When creating a transformed list from an existing list using a for-loop, prefer a list comprehension. List comprehensions are more readable and more performant. Using the below as an example, the list comprehension is ~10% faster on Python 3.11, and ~25% faster on Python 3.10. Note that, as with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in most cases. Example original = list(range(10000)) filtered = [] for i in original: if i % 2: filtered.append(i) Use instead: original = list(range(10000)) filtered = [x for x in original if x % 2] If you're appending to an existing list, use the extend method instead: original = list(range(10000)) filtered.extend(x for x in original if x % 2)",
