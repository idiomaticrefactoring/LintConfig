  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: list-reverse-copy] [Message: Use of assignment of <code>reversed</code> on list <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for list reversals that can be performed in-place in lieu of creating a new list. Why is this bad? When reversing a list, it's more efficient to use the in-place method .reverse() instead of creating a new list, if the original list is no longer needed. Example l = [1, 2, 3] l = reversed(l) l = [1, 2, 3] l = list(reversed(l)) l = [1, 2, 3] l = l[::-1] Use instead: l = [1, 2, 3] l.reverse() Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as calling .reverse() on a list will mutate the list in-place, unlike reversed, which creates a new list and leaves the original list unchanged. If the list is referenced elsewhere, this could lead to unexpected behavior.",
