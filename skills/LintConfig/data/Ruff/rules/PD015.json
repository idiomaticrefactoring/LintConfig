  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-pd-merge] [Message: Use <code>.merge</code> method instead of <code>pd.merge</code> function. They have equivalent functionality.] What it does Checks for uses of pd.merge on Pandas objects. Why is this bad? In Pandas, the .merge method (exposed on, e.g., DataFrame objects) and the pd.merge function (exposed on the Pandas module) are equivalent. For consistency, prefer calling .merge on an object over calling pd.merge on the Pandas module, as the former is more idiomatic. Further, pd.merge is not a method, but a function, which prohibits it from being used in method chains, a common pattern in Pandas code. Example import pandas as pd cats_df = pd.read_csv(\"cats.csv\") dogs_df = pd.read_csv(\"dogs.csv\") rabbits_df = pd.read_csv(\"rabbits.csv\") pets_df = pd.merge(pd.merge(cats_df, dogs_df), rabbits_df) # Hard to read. Use instead: import pandas as pd cats_df = pd.read_csv(\"cats.csv\") dogs_df = pd.read_csv(\"dogs.csv\") rabbits_df = pd.read_csv(\"rabbits.csv\") pets_df = cats_df.merge(dogs_df).merge(rabbits_df)",
