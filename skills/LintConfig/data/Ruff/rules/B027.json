  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: empty-method-without-abstract-decorator] [Message: <code>{name}</code> is an empty method in an abstract base class, but has no abstract decorator] What it does Checks for empty methods in abstract base classes without an abstract decorator. Why is this bad? Empty methods in abstract base classes without an abstract decorator may be be indicative of a mistake. If the method is meant to be abstract, add an @abstractmethod decorator to the method. Example from abc import ABC class Foo(ABC): def method(self): ... Use instead: from abc import ABC, abstractmethod class Foo(ABC): @abstractmethod def method(self): ...",
