  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: expr-and-false] [Message: Use <code>{expr}</code> instead of <code>{replaced}</code>] What it does Checks for and expressions that contain falsey values. Why is this bad? If the expression is used as a condition, it can be replaced in-full with False. In other cases, the expression can be short-circuited to the first falsey value. By using False (or the first falsey value), the code is more concise and easier to understand, since it no longer contains redundant conditions. Example if x and [] and y: pass a = x and [] and y Use instead: if False: pass a = x and []",
