  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: complex-if-statement-in-stub] [Message: <code>if</code> test must be a simple comparison against <code>sys.platform</code> or <code>sys.version_info</code>] What it does Checks for if statements with complex conditionals in stubs. Why is this bad? Type checkers understand simple conditionals to express variations between different Python versions and platforms. However, complex tests may not be understood by a type checker, leading to incorrect inferences when they analyze your code. Example import sys if (3, 10) <= sys.version_info < (3, 12): ... Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info >= (3, 10) and sys.version_info < (3, 12): ...",
