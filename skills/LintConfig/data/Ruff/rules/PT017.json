  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-assert-in-except] [Message: Found assertion on exception <code>{name}</code> in <code>except</code> block, use <code>pytest.raises()</code> instead] What it does Checks for assert statements in except clauses. Why is this bad? When testing for exceptions, pytest.raises() should be used instead of assert statements in except clauses, as it's more explicit and idiomatic. Further, pytest.raises() will fail if the exception is not raised, unlike the assert statement. Example def test_foo(): try: 1 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError as e: assert e.args Use instead: import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError) as exc_info: 1 / 0 assert exc_info.value.args Or, for pytest 8.4.0 and later: import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, check=lambda e: e.args): 1 / 0",
