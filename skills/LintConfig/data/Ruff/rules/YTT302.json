  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version-cmp-str10] [Message: <code>sys.version</code> compared to string (python10), use <code>sys.version_info</code>] What it does Checks for comparisons that test sys.version against string literals, such that the comparison would fail if the major version number were ever incremented to Python 10 or higher. Why is this bad? Comparing sys.version to a string is error-prone and may cause subtle bugs, as the comparison will be performed lexicographically, not semantically. Instead, use sys.version_info to access the current major and minor version numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples without issue. Example import sys sys.version >= \"3\" # `False` on Python 10. Use instead: import sys sys.version_info >= (3,) # `True` on Python 10.",
