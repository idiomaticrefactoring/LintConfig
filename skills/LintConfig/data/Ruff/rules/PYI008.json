  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unrecognized-platform-name] [Message: Unrecognized platform <code>{platform}</code>] What it does Check for unrecognized platform names in sys.platform checks. Note: this rule is only enabled in .pyi stub files. Why is this bad? If a sys.platform check compares to a platform name outside of a small set of known platforms (e.g. \"linux\", \"win32\", etc.), it's likely a typo or a platform name that is not recognized by type checkers. The list of known platforms is: \"linux\", \"win32\", \"cygwin\", \"darwin\". Example import sys if sys.platform == \"linus\": ... Use instead: import sys if sys.platform == \"linux\": ...",
