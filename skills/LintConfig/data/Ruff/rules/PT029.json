  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: pytest-warns-without-warning] [Message: Set the expected warning in <code>pytest.warns()</code>] What it does Checks for pytest.warns calls without an expected warning. Why is this bad? pytest.warns expects to receive an expected warning as its first argument. If omitted, the pytest.warns call will fail at runtime. Example import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.warns(): do_something() Use instead: import pytest def test_foo(): with pytest.warns(SomeWarning): do_something()",
