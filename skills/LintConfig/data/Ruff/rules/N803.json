  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-argument-name] [Message: Argument name <code>{name}</code> should be lowercase] What it does Checks for argument names that do not follow the snake_case convention. Why is this bad? PEP 8 recommends that function names should be lower case and separated by underscores (also known as snake_case). Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Variable names follow the same convention as function names. mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility. Methods decorated with @typing.override are ignored. Example def my_function(A, myArg): pass Use instead: def my_function(a, my_arg): pass",
