  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: if-expr-min-max] [Message: Replace <code>if</code> expression with <code>{min_max}</code> call] What it does Checks for if expressions that can be replaced with min() or max() calls. Why is this bad? An if expression that selects the lesser or greater of two sub-expressions can be replaced with a min() or max() call respectively. When possible, prefer min() and max(), as they're more concise and readable than the equivalent if expression. Example score1, score2 = 4, 5 highest_score = score1 if score1 > score2 else score2 Use instead: score1, score2 = 4, 5 highest_score = max(score2, score1) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the expression contains comments.",
