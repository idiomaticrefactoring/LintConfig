  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: docstring-extraneous-exception] [Message: Raised exception is not explicitly raised: <code>{id}</code>] What it does Checks for function docstrings that state that exceptions could be raised even though they are not directly raised in the function body. Why is this bad? Some conventions prefer non-explicit exceptions be omitted from the docstring. This rule is not enforced for abstract methods. It is also ignored for \"stub functions\": functions where the body only consists of pass, ..., raise NotImplementedError, or similar. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. Raises: ZeroDivisionError: Divided by zero. \"\"\" return distance / time Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Args: distance: Distance traveled. time: Time spent traveling. Returns: Speed as distance divided by time. \"\"\" return distance / time Known issues It may often be desirable to document all exceptions that a function could possibly raise, even those which are not explicitly raised using raise statements in the function body.",
