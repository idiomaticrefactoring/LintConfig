  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-class-metaclass-type] [Message: Class <code>{name}</code> uses <code>metaclass=type</code>, which is redundant] What it does Checks for metaclass=type in class definitions. Why is this bad? Since Python 3, the default metaclass is type, so specifying it explicitly is redundant. Even though __prepare__ is not required, the default metaclass (type) implements it, for the convenience of subclasses calling it via super(). Example class Foo(metaclass=type): ... Use instead: class Foo: ...",
