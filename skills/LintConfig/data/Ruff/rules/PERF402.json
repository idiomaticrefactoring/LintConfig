  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: manual-list-copy] [Message: Use <code>list</code> or <code>list.copy</code> to create a copy of a list] What it does Checks for for loops that can be replaced by a making a copy of a list. Why is this bad? When creating a copy of an existing list using a for-loop, prefer list or list.copy instead. Making a direct copy is more readable and more performant. Using the below as an example, the list-based copy is ~2x faster on Python 3.11. Note that, as with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a micro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in most cases. Example original = list(range(10000)) filtered = [] for i in original: filtered.append(i) Use instead: original = list(range(10000)) filtered = list(original)",
