  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: sorted-min-max] [Message: Prefer <code>min</code> over <code>sorted()</code> to compute the minimum value in a sequence] What it does Checks for uses of sorted() to retrieve the minimum or maximum value in a sequence. Why is this bad? Using sorted() to compute the minimum or maximum value in a sequence is inefficient and less readable than using min() or max() directly. Example nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] lowest = sorted(nums)[0] highest = sorted(nums)[-1] highest = sorted(nums, reverse=True)[0] Use instead: nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] lowest = min(nums) highest = max(nums) Fix safety In some cases, migrating to min or max can lead to a change in behavior, notably when breaking ties. As an example, sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)[0] will return the last \"minimum\" element in the list, if there are multiple elements with the same key. However, min(data, key=itemgetter(0)) will return the first \"minimum\" element in the list in the same scenario. As such, this rule's fix is marked as unsafe.",
