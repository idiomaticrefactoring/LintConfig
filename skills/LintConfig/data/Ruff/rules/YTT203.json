  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version-info1-cmp-int] [Message: <code>sys.version_info[1]</code> compared to integer (python4), compare <code>sys.version_info</code> to tuple] What it does Checks for comparisons that test sys.version_info[1] against an integer. Why is this bad? Comparisons based on the current minor version number alone can cause subtle bugs and would likely lead to unintended effects if the Python major version number were ever incremented (e.g., to Python 4). Instead, compare sys.version_info to a tuple, including the major and minor version numbers, to future-proof the code. Example import sys if sys.version_info[1] < 7: print(\"Python 3.6 or earlier.\") # This will be printed on Python 4.0. Use instead: import sys if sys.version_info < (3, 7): print(\"Python 3.6 or earlier.\")",
