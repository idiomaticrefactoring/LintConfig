  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-character-sub] [Message: Invalid unescaped character SUB, use \"\\x1a\" instead] What it does Checks for strings that contain the raw control character SUB. Why is this bad? Control characters are displayed differently by different text editors and terminals. By using the \\x1a sequence in lieu of the SUB control character, the string will contain the same value, but will render visibly in all editors. Example x = \"\" Use instead: x = \"\\x1a\"",
