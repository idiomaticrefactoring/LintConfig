  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-try-block-exception] [Message: try-except* block with duplicate exception <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for try-except blocks with duplicate exception handlers. Why is this bad? Duplicate exception handlers are redundant, as the first handler will catch the exception, making the second handler unreachable. Example try: ... except ValueError: ... except ValueError: ... Use instead: try: ... except ValueError: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the exception handler contains comments.",
