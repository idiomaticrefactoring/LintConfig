  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-final-literal] [Message: <code>Final[Literal[{literal}]]</code> can be replaced with a bare <code>Final</code>] What it does Checks for redundant Final[Literal[...]] annotations. Why is this bad? All constant variables annotated as Final are understood as implicitly having Literal types by a type checker. As such, a Final[Literal[...]] annotation can often be replaced with a bare Final, annotation, which will have the same meaning to the type checker while being more concise and more readable. Example from typing import Final, Literal x: Final[Literal[42]] y: Final[Literal[42]] = 42 Use instead: from typing import Final, Literal x: Final = 42 y: Final = 42",
