  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-paren-on-raise-exception] [Message: Unnecessary parentheses on raised exception] What it does Checks for unnecessary parentheses on raised exceptions. Why is this bad? If an exception is raised without any arguments, parentheses are not required, as the raise statement accepts either an exception instance or an exception class (which is then implicitly instantiated). Removing the parentheses makes the code more concise. Known problems Parentheses can only be omitted if the exception is a class, as opposed to a function call. This rule isn't always capable of distinguishing between the two. For example, if you import a function module.get_exception from another module, and module.get_exception returns an exception object, this rule will incorrectly mark the parentheses in raise module.get_exception() as unnecessary. Example raise TypeError() Use instead: raise TypeError Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if removing the parentheses would also remove comments or if it’s unclear whether the expression is a class or a function call.",
