  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: except-with-empty-tuple] [Message: Using <code>except* ():</code> with an empty tuple does not catch anything; add exceptions to handle] What it does Checks for exception handlers that catch an empty tuple. Why is this bad? An exception handler that catches an empty tuple will not catch anything, and is indicative of a mistake. Instead, add exceptions to the except clause. Example try: 1 / 0 except (): ... Use instead: try: 1 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError: ...",
