  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: try-consider-else] [Message: Consider moving this statement to an <code>else</code> block] What it does Checks for return statements in try blocks. Why is this bad? The try-except statement has an else clause for code that should run only if no exceptions were raised. Returns in try blocks may exhibit confusing or unwanted behavior, such as being overridden by control flow in except and finally blocks, or unintentionally suppressing an exception. Example import logging def reciprocal(n): try: rec = 1 / n print(f\"reciprocal of {n} is {rec}\") return rec except ZeroDivisionError: logging.exception(\"Exception occurred\") raise Use instead: import logging def reciprocal(n): try: rec = 1 / n except ZeroDivisionError: logging.exception(\"Exception occurred\") raise else: print(f\"reciprocal of {n} is {rec}\") return rec",
