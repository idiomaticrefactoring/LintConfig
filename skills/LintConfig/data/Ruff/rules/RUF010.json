  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: explicit-f-string-type-conversion] [Message: Use explicit conversion flag] What it does Checks for uses of str(), repr(), and ascii() as explicit type conversions within f-strings. Why is this bad? f-strings support dedicated conversion flags for these types, which are more succinct and idiomatic. Note that, in many cases, calling str() within an f-string is unnecessary and can be removed entirely, as the value will be converted to a string automatically, the notable exception being for classes that implement a custom __format__ method. Example a = \"some string\" f\"{repr(a)}\" Use instead: a = \"some string\" f\"{a!r}\"",
