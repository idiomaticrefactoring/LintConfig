  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: repeated-equality-comparison] [Message: Consider merging multiple comparisons: <code>{expression}</code>. Use a <code>set</code> if the elements are hashable.] What it does Checks for repeated equality comparisons that can be rewritten as a membership test. This rule will try to determine if the values are hashable and the fix will use a set if they are. If unable to determine, the fix will use a tuple and suggest the use of a set. Why is this bad? To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, it is common to write a series of equality comparisons (e.g., foo == \"bar\" or foo == \"baz\"). Instead, prefer to combine the values into a collection and use the in operator to check for membership, which is more performant and succinct. If the items are hashable, use a set for efficiency; otherwise, use a tuple. Fix safety This rule is always unsafe since literal sets and tuples evaluate their members eagerly whereas or comparisons are short-circuited. It is therefore possible that a fix will change behavior in the presence of side-effects. Example foo == \"bar\" or foo == \"baz\" or foo == \"qux\" Use instead: foo in {\"bar\", \"baz\", \"qux\"}",
