  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: mako-templates] [Message: Mako templates allow HTML and JavaScript rendering by default and are inherently open to XSS attacks] What it does Checks for uses of the mako templates. Why is this bad? Mako templates allow HTML and JavaScript rendering by default, and are inherently open to XSS attacks. Ensure variables in all templates are properly sanitized via the n, h or x flags (depending on context). For example, to HTML escape the variable data, use ${ data |h }. Example from mako.template import Template Template(\"hello\") Use instead: from mako.template import Template Template(\"hello |h\")",
