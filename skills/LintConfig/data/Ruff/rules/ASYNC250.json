  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: blocking-input-in-async-function] [Message: Blocking call to input() in async context] What it does Checks that async functions do not contain blocking usage of input from user. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking input call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for user input, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of making a blocking input call directly, wrap the input call in an executor to execute the blocking call on another thread. Example async def foo(): username = input(\"Username:\") Use instead: import asyncio async def foo(): loop = asyncio.get_running_loop() username = await loop.run_in_executor(None, input, \"Username:\")",
