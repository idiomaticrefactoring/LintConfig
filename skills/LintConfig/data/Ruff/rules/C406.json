  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-literal-dict] [Message: Unnecessary {obj_type} literal (rewrite as a dict literal)] What it does Checks for unnecessary list or tuple literals. Why is this bad? It's unnecessary to use a list or tuple literal within a call to dict(). It can be rewritten as a dict literal ({}). Example dict([(1, 2), (3, 4)]) dict(((1, 2), (3, 4))) dict([]) Use instead: {1: 2, 3: 4} {1: 2, 3: 4} {} Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments when rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved.",
