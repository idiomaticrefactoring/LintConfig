  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: zip-without-explicit-strict] [Message: <code>zip()</code> without an explicit <code>strict=</code> parameter] What it does Checks for zip calls without an explicit strict parameter when called with two or more iterables, or any starred argument. Why is this bad? By default, if the iterables passed to zip are of different lengths, the resulting iterator will be silently truncated to the length of the shortest iterable. This can lead to subtle bugs. Pass strict=True to raise a ValueError if the iterables are of non-uniform length. Alternatively, if the iterables are deliberately of different lengths, pass strict=False to make the intention explicit. Example zip(a, b) Use instead: zip(a, b, strict=True) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe. While adding strict=False preserves the runtime behavior, it can obscure situations where the iterables are of unequal length. Ruff prefers to alert users so they can choose the intended behavior themselves.",
