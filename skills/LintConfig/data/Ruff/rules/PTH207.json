  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: glob] [Message: Replace <code>{function}</code> with <code>Path.glob</code> or <code>Path.rglob</code>] What it does Checks for the use of glob.glob() and glob.iglob(). Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os and glob. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.glob() can improve readability over their low-level counterparts (e.g., glob.glob()). Note that glob.glob() and Path.glob() are not exact equivalents: glob-module functions Path.glob() Hidden files Hidden files are excluded by default. On Python 3.11+, the include_hidden keyword can be used to include hidden directories. Includes hidden files by default. Eagerness glob.iglob() returns a lazy iterator. Under the hood, glob.glob() simply converts the iterator to a list. Path.glob() returns a lazy iterator. Working directory glob.glob() and glob.iglob() take a root_dir keyword to set the current working directory. Path.rglob() can be used to return the relative path. Globstar (**) The recursive flag must be set to True for the ** pattern to match any files and zero or more directories, subdirectories, and symbolic links. The ** pattern in Path.glob() means \"this directory and all subdirectories, recursively\". In other words, it enables recursive globbing. Example import glob import os glob.glob(os.path.join(\"my_path\", \"requirements*.txt\")) Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(\"my_path\").glob(\"requirements*.txt\") Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python.",
