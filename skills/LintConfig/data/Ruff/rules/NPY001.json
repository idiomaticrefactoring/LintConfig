  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: numpy-deprecated-type-alias] [Message: Type alias <code>np.{type_name}</code> is deprecated, replace with builtin type] What it does Checks for deprecated NumPy type aliases. Why is this bad? NumPy's np.int has long been an alias of the builtin int; the same is true of np.float and others. These aliases exist primarily for historic reasons, and have been a cause of frequent confusion for newcomers. These aliases were deprecated in 1.20, and removed in 1.24. Note, however, that np.bool and np.long were reintroduced in 2.0 with different semantics, and are thus omitted from this rule. Example import numpy as np np.int Use instead: int",
