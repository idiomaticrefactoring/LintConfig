  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pandas-use-of-dot-values] [Message: Use <code>.to_numpy()</code> instead of <code>.values</code>] What it does Checks for uses of .values on Pandas Series and Index objects. Why is this bad? The .values attribute is ambiguous as its return type is unclear. As such, it is no longer recommended by the Pandas documentation. Instead, use .to_numpy() to return a NumPy array, or .array to return a Pandas ExtensionArray. Example import pandas as pd animals = pd.read_csv(\"animals.csv\").values # Ambiguous. Use instead: import pandas as pd animals = pd.read_csv(\"animals.csv\").to_numpy() # Explicit.",
