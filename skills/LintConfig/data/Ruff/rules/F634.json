  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: if-tuple] [Message: If test is a tuple, which is always <code>True</code>] What it does Checks for if statements that use non-empty tuples as test conditions. Why is this bad? Non-empty tuples are always True, so an if statement with a non-empty tuple as its test condition will always pass. This is likely a mistake. Example if (False,): print(\"This will always run\") Use instead: if False: print(\"This will never run\")",
