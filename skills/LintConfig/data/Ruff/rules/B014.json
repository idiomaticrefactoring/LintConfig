  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: duplicate-handler-exception] [Message: Exception handler with duplicate exception: <code>{name}</code>] What it does Checks for exception handlers that catch duplicate exceptions. Why is this bad? Including the same exception multiple times in the same handler is redundant, as the first exception will catch the exception, making the second exception unreachable. The same applies to exception hierarchies, as a handler for a parent exception (like Exception) will also catch child exceptions (like ValueError). Example try: ... except (Exception, ValueError): # `Exception` includes `ValueError`. ... Use instead: try: ... except Exception: ...",
