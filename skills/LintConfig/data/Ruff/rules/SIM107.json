  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: return-in-try-except-finally] [Message: Don't use <code>return</code> in <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> and <code>finally</code>] What it does Checks for return statements in try-except and finally blocks. Why is this bad? The return statement in a finally block will always be executed, even if an exception is raised in the try or except block. This can lead to unexpected behavior. Example def squared(n): try: sqr = n**2 return sqr except Exception: return \"An exception occurred\" finally: return -1 # Always returns -1. Use instead: def squared(n): try: return_value = n**2 except Exception: return_value = \"An exception occurred\" finally: return_value = -1 return return_value",
