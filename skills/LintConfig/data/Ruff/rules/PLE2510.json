  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-character-backspace] [Message: Invalid unescaped character backspace, use \"\\b\" instead] What it does Checks for strings that contain the control character BS. Why is this bad? Control characters are displayed differently by different text editors and terminals. By using the \\b sequence in lieu of the BS control character, the string will contain the same value, but will render visibly in all editors. Example x = \"\" Use instead: x = \"\\b\"",
