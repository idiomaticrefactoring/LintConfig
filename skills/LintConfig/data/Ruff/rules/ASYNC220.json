  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: create-subprocess-in-async-function] [Message: Async functions should not create subprocesses with blocking methods] What it does Checks that async functions do not create subprocesses with blocking methods. Why is this bad? Blocking an async function via a blocking call will block the entire event loop, preventing it from executing other tasks while waiting for the call to complete, negating the benefits of asynchronous programming. Instead of making a blocking call, use an equivalent asynchronous library or function, like trio.run_process() or anyio.run_process(). Example import os async def foo(): os.popen(cmd) Use instead: import asyncio async def foo(): asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(cmd)",
