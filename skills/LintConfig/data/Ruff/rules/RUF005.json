  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: collection-literal-concatenation] [Message: Consider <code>{expression}</code> instead of concatenation] What it does Checks for uses of the + operator to concatenate collections. Why is this bad? In Python, the + operator can be used to concatenate collections (e.g., x + y to concatenate the lists x and y). However, collections can be concatenated more efficiently using the unpacking operator (e.g., [*x, *y] to concatenate x and y). Prefer the unpacking operator to concatenate collections, as it is more readable and flexible. The * operator can unpack any iterable, whereas + operates only on particular sequences which, in many cases, must be of the same type. Example foo = [2, 3, 4] bar = [1] + foo + [5, 6] Use instead: foo = [2, 3, 4] bar = [1, *foo, 5, 6] Fix safety The fix is always marked as unsafe because the + operator uses the __add__ magic method and *-unpacking uses the __iter__ magic method. Both of these could have custom implementations, causing the fix to change program behaviour.",
