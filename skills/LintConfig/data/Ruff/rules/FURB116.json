  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: f-string-number-format] [Message: Replace <code>{function_name}</code> call with <code>{display}</code>] What it does Checks for uses of bin(...)[2:] (or hex, or oct) to convert an integer into a string. Why is this bad? When converting an integer to a baseless binary, hexadecimal, or octal string, using f-strings is more concise and readable than using the bin, hex, or oct functions followed by a slice. Example print(bin(1337)[2:]) Use instead: print(f\"{1337:b}\") Fix safety The fix is only marked as safe for integer literals, all other cases are display-only, as they may change the runtime behavior of the program or introduce syntax errors. The fix for integer literals is also marked as unsafe if the expression contains comments that would be removed by the fix.",
