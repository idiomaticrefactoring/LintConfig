  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-length-return-type] [Message: <code>__len__</code> does not return a non-negative integer] What it does Checks for __len__ implementations that return values that are not non-negative integers. Why is this bad? The __len__ method should return a non-negative integer. Returning a different value may cause unexpected behavior. Note: bool is a subclass of int, so it's technically valid for __len__ to return True or False. However, for consistency with other rules, Ruff will still emit a diagnostic when __len__ returns a bool. Example class Foo: def __len__(self): return \"2\" Use instead: class Foo: def __len__(self): return 2",
