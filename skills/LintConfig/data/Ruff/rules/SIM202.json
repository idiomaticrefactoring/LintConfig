  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: negate-not-equal-op] [Message: Use <code>{left} == {right}</code> instead of <code>not {left} != {right}</code>] What it does Checks for negated != operators. Why is this bad? Negated != operators are less readable than == operators, as they avoid a double negation. Example not a != b Use instead: a == b Fix safety The fix is marked as unsafe, as it might change the behaviour if a and/or b overrides __ne__/__eq__ in such a manner that they don't return booleans.",
