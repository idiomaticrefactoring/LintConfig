  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: banned-import-from] [Message: Members of <code>{name}</code> should not be imported explicitly] What it does Checks for member imports that should instead be accessed by importing the module. Why is this bad? Consistency is good. Use a common convention for imports to make your code more readable and idiomatic. For example, it's common to import pandas as pd, and then access members like Series via pd.Series, rather than importing Series directly. Example from pandas import Series Use instead: import pandas as pd pd.Series",
