  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unsorted-dunder-slots] [Message: <code>{}.__slots__</code> is not sorted] What it does Checks for __slots__ definitions that are not ordered according to a natural sort. Why is this bad? Consistency is good. Use a common convention for this special variable to make your code more readable and idiomatic. Example class Dog: __slots__ = \"name\", \"breed\" Use instead: class Dog: __slots__ = \"breed\", \"name\" Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe in three situations. Firstly, the fix is unsafe if there are any comments that take up a whole line by themselves inside the __slots__ definition, for example: class Foo: __slots__ = [ # eggy things \"duck_eggs\", \"chicken_eggs\", # hammy things \"country_ham\", \"parma_ham\", ] This is a common pattern used to delimit categories within a class's slots, but it would be out of the scope of this rule to attempt to maintain these categories when applying a natural sort to the items of __slots__. Secondly, the fix is also marked as unsafe if there are more than two __slots__ items on a single line and that line also has a trailing comment, since here it is impossible to accurately gauge which item the comment should be moved with when sorting __slots__: class Bar: __slots__ = [ \"a\", \"c\", \"e\", # a comment \"b\", \"d\", \"f\", # a second comment ] Lastly, this rule's fix is marked as unsafe whenever Ruff can detect that code elsewhere in the same file reads the __slots__ variable in some way and the __slots__ variable is not assigned to a set. This is because the order of the items in __slots__ may have semantic significance if the __slots__ of a class is being iterated over, or being assigned to another value. In the vast majority of other cases, this rule's fix is unlikely to cause breakage; as such, Ruff will otherwise mark this rule's fix as safe. However, note that (although it's rare) the value of __slots__ could still be read by code outside of the module in which the __slots__ definition occurs, in which case this rule's fix could theoretically cause breakage.",
