  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: string-or-bytes-too-long] [Message: String and bytes literals longer than 50 characters are not permitted] What it does Checks for the use of string and bytes literals longer than 50 characters in stub (.pyi) files. Why is this bad? If a function or variable has a default value where the string or bytes representation is greater than 50 characters long, it is likely to be an implementation detail or a constant that varies depending on the system you're running on. Although IDEs may find them useful, default values are ignored by type checkers, the primary consumers of stub files. Replace very long constants with ellipses (...) to simplify the stub. Example def foo(arg: str = \"51 character stringgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg\") -> None: ... Use instead: def foo(arg: str = ...) -> None: ...",
