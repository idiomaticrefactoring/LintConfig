  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: type-comment-in-stub] [Message: Don't use type comments in stub file] What it does Checks for the use of type comments (e.g., x = 1 # type: int) in stub files. Why is this bad? Stub (.pyi) files should use type annotations directly, rather than type comments, even if they're intended to support Python 2, since stub files are not executed at runtime. The one exception is # type: ignore. Example x = 1 # type: int Use instead: x: int = 1",
