  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: load-before-global-declaration] [Message: Name <code>{name}</code> is used prior to global declaration on {row}] What it does Checks for uses of names that are declared as global prior to the relevant global declaration. Why is this bad? The global declaration applies to the entire scope. Using a name that's declared as global in a given scope prior to the relevant global declaration is a SyntaxError. Example counter = 1 def increment(): print(f\"Adding 1 to {counter}\") global counter counter += 1 Use instead: counter = 1 def increment(): global counter print(f\"Adding 1 to {counter}\") counter += 1",
