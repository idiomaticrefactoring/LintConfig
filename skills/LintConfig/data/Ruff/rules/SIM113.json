  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: enumerate-for-loop] [Message: Use <code>enumerate()</code> for index variable <code>{index}</code> in <code>for</code> loop] What it does Checks for for loops with explicit loop-index variables that can be replaced with enumerate(). In preview, this rule checks for index variables initialized with any integer rather than only a literal zero. Why is this bad? When iterating over a sequence, it's often desirable to keep track of the index of each element alongside the element itself. Prefer the enumerate builtin over manually incrementing a counter variable within the loop, as enumerate is more concise and idiomatic. Example fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"] i = 0 for fruit in fruits: print(f\"{i + 1}. {fruit}\") i += 1 Use instead: fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"] for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits): print(f\"{i + 1}. {fruit}\")",
