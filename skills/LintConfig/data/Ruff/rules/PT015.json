  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-assert-always-false] [Message: Assertion always fails, replace with <code>pytest.fail()</code>] What it does Checks for assert statements whose test expression is a falsy value. Why is this bad? pytest.fail conveys the intent more clearly than assert falsy_value. Example def test_foo(): if some_condition: assert False, \"some_condition was True\" Use instead: import pytest def test_foo(): if some_condition: pytest.fail(\"some_condition was True\") ...",
