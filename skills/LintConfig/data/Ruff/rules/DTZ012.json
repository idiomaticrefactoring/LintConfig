  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: call-date-fromtimestamp] [Message: <code>datetime.date.fromtimestamp()</code> used] What it does Checks for usage of datetime.date.fromtimestamp(). Why is this bad? Python date objects are naive, that is, not timezone-aware. While an aware object represents a specific moment in time, a naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other datetime objects. Since this can lead to errors, it is recommended to always use timezone-aware objects. datetime.date.fromtimestamp(ts) returns a naive date object. Instead, use datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts, tz=...).date() to create a timezone-aware datetime object and retrieve its date component. Example import datetime datetime.date.fromtimestamp(946684800) Use instead: import datetime datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.timezone.utc).date() Or, for Python 3.11 and later: import datetime datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.UTC).date()",
