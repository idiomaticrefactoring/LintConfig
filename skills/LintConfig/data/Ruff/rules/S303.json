  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage] [Message: Use of insecure MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1 hash function] What it does Checks for uses of weak or broken cryptographic hash functions. Why is this bad? Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash) or pre-image attacks (where an attacker can find an input that produces a given hash). This can lead to security vulnerabilities in applications that rely on these hash functions. Avoid using weak or broken cryptographic hash functions in security contexts. Instead, use a known secure hash function such as SHA-256. In preview, this rule will also flag references to insecure hash functions. Example from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.MD5()) digest.update(b\"Hello, world!\") digest.finalize() Use instead: from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256()) digest.update(b\"Hello, world!\") digest.finalize()",
