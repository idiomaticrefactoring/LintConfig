Why is this bad? The SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 protocols are considered insecure as they do not support encryption. Instead, prefer SNMPv3, which supports encryption. Example from pysnmp.hlapi import CommunityData CommunityData(\"public\", mpModel=0) Use instead: from pysnmp.hlapi import CommunityData CommunityData(\"public\", mpModel=2)",
