  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: percent-format-positional-count-mismatch] [Message: <code>%</code>-format string has {wanted} placeholder(s) but {got} substitution(s)] What it does Checks for printf-style format strings that have a mismatch between the number of positional placeholders and the number of substitution values. Why is this bad? When a printf-style format string is provided with too many or too few substitution values, it will raise a TypeError at runtime. Example \"%s, %s\" % (\"Hello\", \"world\", \"!\") Use instead: \"%s, %s\" % (\"Hello\", \"world\")",
