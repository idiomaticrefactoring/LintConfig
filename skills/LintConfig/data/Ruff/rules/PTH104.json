  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: os-rename] [Message: <code>os.rename()</code> should be replaced by <code>Path.rename()</code>] What it does Checks for uses of os.rename. Why is this bad? pathlib offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to the lower-level API offered by os. When possible, using Path object methods such as Path.rename() can improve readability over the os module's counterparts (e.g., os.rename()). Examples import os os.rename(\"old.py\", \"new.py\") Use instead: from pathlib import Path Path(\"old.py\").rename(\"new.py\") Known issues While using pathlib can improve the readability and type safety of your code, it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings, especially on older versions of Python. Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression. Additionally, the fix is marked as unsafe when the return value is used because the type changes from None to a Path object.",
