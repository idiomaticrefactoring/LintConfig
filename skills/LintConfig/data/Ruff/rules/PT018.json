  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-composite-assertion] [Message: Assertion should be broken down into multiple parts] What it does Checks for assertions that combine multiple independent conditions. Why is this bad? Composite assertion statements are harder to debug upon failure, as the failure message will not indicate which condition failed. Example def test_foo(): assert something and something_else def test_bar(): assert not (something or something_else) Use instead: def test_foo(): assert something assert something_else def test_bar(): assert not something assert not something_else",
