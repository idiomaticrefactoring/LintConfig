  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unassigned-special-variable-in-stub] [Message: <code>{name}</code> in a stub file must have a value, as it has the same semantics as <code>{name}</code> at runtime] What it does Checks that __all__, __match_args__, and __slots__ variables are assigned to values when defined in stub files. Why is this bad? Special variables like __all__ have the same semantics in stub files as they do in Python modules, and so should be consistent with their runtime counterparts. Example __all__: list[str] Use instead: __all__: list[str] = [\"foo\", \"bar\"]",
