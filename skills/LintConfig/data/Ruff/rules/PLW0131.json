  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: named-expr-without-context] [Message: Named expression used without context] What it does Checks for uses of named expressions (e.g., a := 42) that can be replaced by regular assignment statements (e.g., a = 42). Why is this bad? While a top-level named expression is syntactically and semantically valid, it's less clear than a regular assignment statement. Named expressions are intended to be used in comprehensions and generator expressions, where assignment statements are not allowed. Example (a := 42) Use instead: a = 42",
