  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: sys-version-slice1] [Message: <code>sys.version[:1]</code> referenced (python10), use <code>sys.version_info</code>] What it does Checks for uses of sys.version[:1]. Why is this bad? If the major version number consists of more than one digit, this will select the first digit of the major version number only (e.g., \"10.0\" would evaluate to \"1\"). This is likely unintended, and can lead to subtle bugs in future versions of Python if the version string is used to test against a specific major version number. Instead, use sys.version_info.major to access the current major version number. Example import sys sys.version[:1] # If using Python 10, this evaluates to \"1\". Use instead: import sys f\"{sys.version_info.major}\" # If using Python 10, this evaluates to \"10\".",
