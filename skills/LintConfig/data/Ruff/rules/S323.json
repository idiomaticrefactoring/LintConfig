  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suspicious-unverified-context-usage] [Message: Python allows using an insecure context via the <code>_create_unverified_context</code> that reverts to the previous behavior that does not validate certificates or perform hostname checks.] What it does Checks for uses of ssl._create_unverified_context. Why is this bad? PEP 476 enabled certificate and hostname validation by default in Python standard library HTTP clients. Previously, Python did not validate certificates by default, which could allow an attacker to perform a \"man in the middle\" attack by intercepting and modifying traffic between client and server. To support legacy environments, ssl._create_unverified_context reverts to the previous behavior that does perform verification. Otherwise, use ssl.create_default_context to create a secure context. In preview, this rule will also flag references to ssl._create_unverified_context. Example import ssl context = ssl._create_unverified_context() Use instead: import ssl context = ssl.create_default_context()",
