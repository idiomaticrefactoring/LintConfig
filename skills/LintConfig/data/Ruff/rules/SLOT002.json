  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: no-slots-in-namedtuple-subclass] [Message: Subclasses of {namedtuple_kind} should define <code>__slots__</code>] What it does Checks for subclasses of collections.namedtuple or typing.NamedTuple that lack a __slots__ definition. Why is this bad? In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory overhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory savings. Subclasses of namedtuple inherit all the attributes and methods of the built-in namedtuple class. Since tuples are typically immutable, they don't require additional attributes beyond what the namedtuple class provides. Defining __slots__ for subclasses of namedtuple prevents the creation of a dictionary for each instance, reducing memory consumption. Example from collections import namedtuple class Foo(namedtuple(\"foo\", [\"str\", \"int\"])): pass Use instead: from collections import namedtuple class Foo(namedtuple(\"foo\", [\"str\", \"int\"])): __slots__ = ()",
