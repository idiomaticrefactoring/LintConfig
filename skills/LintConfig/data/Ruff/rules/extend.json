Most settings follow simple override\nbehavior where the child value replaces the parent value. However,\nrule selection (`lint.select` and `lint.ignore`) has special merging\nbehavior: if the child configuration specifies `lint.select`, it\nestablishes a new baseline rule set and the parent's `lint.ignore`\nrules are discarded; if the child configuration omits `lint.select`,\nthe parent's rule selection is inherited and both parent and child\n`lint.ignore` rules are accumulated together.",
