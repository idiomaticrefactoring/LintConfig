  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: django-model-without-dunder-str] [Message: Model does not define <code>__str__</code> method] What it does Checks that a __str__ method is defined in Django models. Why is this bad? Django models should define a __str__ method to return a string representation of the model instance, as Django calls this method to display the object in the Django Admin and elsewhere. Models without a __str__ method will display a non-meaningful representation of the object in the Django Admin. Example from django.db import models class MyModel(models.Model): field = models.CharField(max_length=255) Use instead: from django.db import models class MyModel(models.Model): field = models.CharField(max_length=255) def __str__(self): return f\"{self.field}\"",
