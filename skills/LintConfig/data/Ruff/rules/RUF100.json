  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unused-noqa] [Message: Unused {}] What it does Checks for noqa directives that are no longer applicable. Why is this bad? A noqa directive that no longer matches any diagnostic violations is likely included by mistake, and should be removed to avoid confusion. Example import foo # noqa: F401 def bar(): foo.bar() Use instead: import foo def bar(): foo.bar() Conflict with other linters When using RUF100 with the --fix option, Ruff may remove trailing comments that follow a # noqa directive on the same line, as it interprets the remainder of the line as a description for the suppression. To prevent Ruff from removing suppressions for other tools (like pylint or mypy), separate them with a second # character: # Bad: Ruff --fix will remove the pylint comment def visit_ImportFrom(self, node): # noqa: N802, pylint: disable=invalid-name pass # Good: Ruff will preserve the pylint comment def visit_ImportFrom(self, node): # noqa: N802 # pylint: disable=invalid-name pass",
