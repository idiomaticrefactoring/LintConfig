  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: single-string-slots] [Message: Class <code>__slots__</code> should be a non-string iterable] What it does Checks for single strings assigned to __slots__. Why is this bad? In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory overhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory savings. Any string iterable may be assigned to __slots__ (most commonly, a tuple of strings). If a string is assigned to __slots__, it is interpreted as a single attribute name, rather than an iterable of attribute names. This can cause confusion, as users that iterate over the __slots__ value may expect to iterate over a sequence of attributes, but would instead iterate over the characters of the string. To use a single string attribute in __slots__, wrap the string in an iterable container type, like a tuple. Example class Person: __slots__: str = \"name\" def __init__(self, name: str) -> None: self.name = name Use instead: class Person: __slots__: tuple[str, ...] = (\"name\",) def __init__(self, name: str) -> None: self.name = name",
