  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-none-literal] [Message: Use <code>None</code> rather than <code>Literal[None]</code>] What it does Checks for redundant Literal[None] annotations. Why is this bad? While Literal[None] is a valid type annotation, it is semantically equivalent to None. Prefer None over Literal[None] for both consistency and readability. Example from typing import Literal Literal[None] Literal[1, 2, 3, \"foo\", 5, None] Use instead: from typing import Literal None Literal[1, 2, 3, \"foo\", 5] | None Fix safety and availability This rule's fix is marked as safe unless the literal contains comments. There is currently no fix available when applying the fix would lead to a TypeError from an expression of the form None | None or when we are unable to import the symbol typing.Optional and the Python version is 3.9 or below.",
