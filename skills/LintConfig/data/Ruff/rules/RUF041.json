  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-nested-literal] [Message: Unnecessary nested <code>Literal</code>] What it does Checks for unnecessary nested Literal. Why is this bad? Prefer using a single Literal, which is equivalent and more concise. Parameterization of literals by other literals is supported as an ergonomic feature as proposed in PEP 586, to enable patterns such as: ReadOnlyMode = Literal[\"r\", \"r+\"] WriteAndTruncateMode = Literal[\"w\", \"w+\", \"wt\", \"w+t\"] WriteNoTruncateMode = Literal[\"r+\", \"r+t\"] AppendMode = Literal[\"a\", \"a+\", \"at\", \"a+t\"] AllModes = Literal[ReadOnlyMode, WriteAndTruncateMode, WriteNoTruncateMode, AppendMode] As a consequence, type checkers also support nesting of literals which is less readable than a flat Literal: AllModes = Literal[Literal[\"r\", \"r+\"], Literal[\"w\", \"w+\", \"wt\", \"w+t\"], Literal[\"r+\", \"r+t\"], Literal[\"a\", \"a+\", \"at\", \"a+t\"]] Example AllModes = Literal[ Literal[\"r\", \"r+\"], Literal[\"w\", \"w+\", \"wt\", \"w+t\"], Literal[\"r+\", \"r+t\"], Literal[\"a\", \"a+\", \"at\", \"a+t\"], ] Use instead: AllModes = Literal[ \"r\", \"r+\", \"w\", \"w+\", \"wt\", \"w+t\", \"r+\", \"r+t\", \"a\", \"a+\", \"at\", \"a+t\" ] or assign the literal to a variable as in the first example. Fix safety The fix for this rule is marked as unsafe when the Literal slice is split across multiple lines and some of the lines have trailing comments.",
