  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: start-process-with-partial-path] [Message: Starting a process with a partial executable path] What it does Checks for the starting of a process with a partial executable path. Why is this bad? Starting a process with a partial executable path can allow attackers to execute an arbitrary executable by adjusting the PATH environment variable. Consider using a full path to the executable instead. Example import subprocess subprocess.Popen([\"ruff\", \"check\", \"file.py\"]) Use instead: import subprocess subprocess.Popen([\"/usr/bin/ruff\", \"check\", \"file.py\"])",
