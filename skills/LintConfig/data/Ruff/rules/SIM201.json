  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: negate-equal-op] [Message: Use <code>{left} != {right}</code> instead of <code>not {left} == {right}</code>] What it does Checks for negated == operators. Why is this bad? Negated == operators are less readable than != operators. When testing for non-equality, it is more common to use != than ==. Example not a == b Use instead: a != b Fix safety The fix is marked as unsafe, as it might change the behaviour if a and/or b overrides __eq__/__ne__ in such a manner that they don't return booleans.",
