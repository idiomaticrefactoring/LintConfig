Why is this bad? Performing a membership test against a container (like a list or set) with a single item is less readable and less efficient than comparing against the item directly. Example 1 in [1] Use instead: 1 == 1 Fix safety The fix is always marked as unsafe. When the right-hand side is a string, this fix can change the behavior of your program. This is because c in \"a\" is true both when c is \"a\" and when c is the empty string. Additionally, converting in/not in against a single-item container to ==/!= can change runtime behavior: in may consider identity (e.g., NaN) and always yields a bool. Comments within the replacement range will also be removed.",
