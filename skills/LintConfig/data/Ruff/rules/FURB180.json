  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: meta-class-abc-meta] [Message: Use of <code>metaclass=abc.ABCMeta</code> to define abstract base class] What it does Checks for uses of metaclass=abc.ABCMeta to define abstract base classes (ABCs). Why is this bad? Instead of class C(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta): ..., use class C(ABC): ... to define an abstract base class. Inheriting from the ABC wrapper class is semantically identical to setting metaclass=abc.ABCMeta, but more succinct. Example import abc class C(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta): pass Use instead: import abc class C(abc.ABC): pass Fix safety The rule's fix is unsafe if the class has base classes. This is because the base classes might be validating the class's other base classes (e.g., typing.Protocol does this) or otherwise alter runtime behavior if more base classes are added.",
