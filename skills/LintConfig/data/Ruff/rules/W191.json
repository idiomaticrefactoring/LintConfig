  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: tab-indentation] [Message: Indentation contains tabs] What it does Checks for indentation that uses tabs. Why is this bad? According to PEP 8, spaces are preferred over tabs (unless used to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs). Formatter compatibility We recommend against using this rule alongside the formatter. The formatter enforces consistent indentation, making the rule redundant. The rule is also incompatible with the formatter when using format.indent-style=\"tab\".",
