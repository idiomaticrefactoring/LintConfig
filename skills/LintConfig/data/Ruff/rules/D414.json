  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: empty-docstring-section] [Message: Section has no content (\"{name}\")] What it does Checks for docstrings with empty sections. Why is this bad? An empty section in a multiline docstring likely indicates an unfinished or incomplete docstring. Multiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header and a section body. Each section body should be non-empty; empty sections should either have content added to them, or be removed entirely. Example def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Parameters ---------- distance : float Distance traveled. time : float Time spent traveling. Returns ------- float Speed as distance divided by time. Raises ------ \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc Use instead: def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate speed as distance divided by time. Parameters ---------- distance : float Distance traveled. time : float Time spent traveling. Returns ------- float Speed as distance divided by time. Raises ------ FasterThanLightError If speed is greater than the speed of light. \"\"\" try: return distance / time except ZeroDivisionError as exc: raise FasterThanLightError from exc",
