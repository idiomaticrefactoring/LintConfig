  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: binary-op-exception] [Message: Exception to catch is the result of a binary <code>and</code> operation] What it does Checks for except clauses that attempt to catch multiple exceptions with a binary operation (and or or). Why is this bad? A binary operation will not catch multiple exceptions. Instead, the binary operation will be evaluated first, and the result of that operation will be caught (for an or operation, this is typically the first exception in the list). This is almost never the desired behavior. Example try: pass except A or B: pass Use instead: try: pass except (A, B): pass",
