  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: subprocess-popen-preexec-fn] [Message: <code>preexec_fn</code> argument is unsafe when using threads] What it does Checks for uses of subprocess.Popen with a preexec_fn argument. Why is this bad? The preexec_fn argument is unsafe within threads as it can lead to deadlocks. Furthermore, preexec_fn is targeted for deprecation. Instead, consider using task-specific arguments such as env, start_new_session, and process_group. These are not prone to deadlocks and are more explicit. Example import os, subprocess subprocess.Popen(foo, preexec_fn=os.setsid) subprocess.Popen(bar, preexec_fn=os.setpgid(0, 0)) Use instead: import subprocess subprocess.Popen(foo, start_new_session=True) subprocess.Popen(bar, process_group=0) # Introduced in Python 3.11",
