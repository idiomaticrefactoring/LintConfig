  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: ssl-insecure-version] [Message: Call made with insecure SSL protocol: <code>{protocol}</code>] What it does Checks for function calls with parameters that indicate the use of insecure SSL and TLS protocol versions. Why is this bad? Several highly publicized exploitable flaws have been discovered in all versions of SSL and early versions of TLS. The following versions are considered insecure, and should be avoided: SSL v2 SSL v3 TLS v1 TLS v1.1 This method supports detection on the Python's built-in ssl module and the pyOpenSSL module. Example import ssl ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1) Use instead: import ssl ssl.wrap_socket(ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)",
