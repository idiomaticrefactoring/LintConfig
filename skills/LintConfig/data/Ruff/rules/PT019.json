  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: pytest-fixture-param-without-value] [Message: Fixture <code>{name}</code> without value is injected as parameter, use <code>@pytest.mark.usefixtures</code> instead] What it does Checks for pytest test functions that should be decorated with @pytest.mark.usefixtures. Why is this bad? In pytest, fixture injection is used to activate fixtures in a test function. Fixtures can be injected either by passing them as parameters to the test function, or by using the @pytest.mark.usefixtures decorator. If the test function depends on the fixture being activated, but does not use it in the test body or otherwise rely on its return value, prefer the @pytest.mark.usefixtures decorator, to make the dependency explicit and avoid the confusion caused by unused arguments. Example import pytest @pytest.fixture def _patch_something(): ... def test_foo(_patch_something): ... Use instead: import pytest @pytest.fixture def _patch_something(): ... @pytest.mark.usefixtures(\"_patch_something\") def test_foo(): ...",
