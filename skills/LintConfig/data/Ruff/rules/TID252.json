Absolute imports, or relative imports from siblings, are recommended by PEP 8: Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved... import mypkg.sibling from mypkg import sibling from mypkg.sibling import example However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose: from . import sibling from .sibling import example Example from .. import foo Use instead: from mypkg import foo",
