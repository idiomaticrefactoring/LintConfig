  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: shebang-missing-executable-file] [Message: The file is executable but no shebang is present] What it does Checks for executable .py files that do not have a shebang. Why is this bad? In Python, a shebang (also known as a hashbang) is the first line of a script, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. If a .py file is executable, but does not have a shebang, it may be run with the wrong interpreter, or fail to run at all. If the file is meant to be executable, add a shebang, as in: #!/usr/bin/env python Otherwise, remove the executable bit from the file (e.g., chmod -x __main__.py or git update-index --chmod=-x __main__.py). A file is considered executable if it has the executable bit set (i.e., its permissions mode intersects with 0o111). As such, this rule is only available on Unix-like systems, and is not enforced on Windows or WSL.",
