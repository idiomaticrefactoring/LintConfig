  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: never-union] [Message: <code>{never_like} | T</code> is equivalent to <code>T</code>] What it does Checks for uses of typing.NoReturn and typing.Never in union types. Why is this bad? typing.NoReturn and typing.Never are special types, used to indicate that a function never returns, or that a type has no values. Including typing.NoReturn or typing.Never in a union type is redundant, as, e.g., typing.Never | T is equivalent to T. Example from typing import Never def func() -> Never | int: ... Use instead: def func() -> int: ... Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the union type contains comments.",
