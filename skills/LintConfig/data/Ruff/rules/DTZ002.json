  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: call-datetime-today] [Message: <code>datetime.datetime.today()</code> used] What it does Checks for usage of datetime.datetime.today(). Why is this bad? datetime objects are \"naive\" by default, in that they do not include timezone information. \"Naive\" objects are easy to understand, but ignore some aspects of reality, which can lead to subtle bugs. Timezone-aware datetime objects are preferred, as they represent a specific moment in time, unlike \"naive\" objects. datetime.datetime.today() creates a \"naive\" object; instead, use datetime.datetime.now(tz=...) to create a timezone-aware object. Example import datetime datetime.datetime.today() Use instead: import datetime datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc) Or, for Python 3.11 and later: import datetime datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC)",
