  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: class-with-mixed-type-vars] [Message: Class with type parameter list inherits from <code>Generic</code>] What it does Checks for classes that have PEP 695 while also inheriting from typing.Generic or typing_extensions.Generic. Why is this bad? Such classes cause errors at runtime: from typing import Generic, TypeVar U = TypeVar(\"U\") # TypeError: Cannot inherit from Generic[...] multiple times. class C[T](Generic[U]): ... Example from typing import Generic, ParamSpec, TypeVar, TypeVarTuple U = TypeVar(\"U\") P = ParamSpec(\"P\") Ts = TypeVarTuple(\"Ts\") class C[T](Generic[U, P, *Ts]): ... Use instead: class C[T, U, **P, *Ts]: ... Fix safety As the fix changes runtime behaviour, it is always marked as unsafe. Additionally, comments within the fix range will not be preserved.",
