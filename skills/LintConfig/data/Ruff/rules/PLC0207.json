  "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: missing-maxsplit-arg] [Message: Replace with <code>{suggested_split_type}(..., maxsplit=1)</code>.] What it does Checks for access to the first or last element of str.split() or str.rsplit() without maxsplit=1 Why is this bad? Calling str.split() or str.rsplit() without passing maxsplit=1 splits on every delimiter in the string. When accessing only the first or last element of the result, it would be more efficient to only split once. Example url = \"www.example.com\" prefix = url.split(\".\")[0] Use instead: url = \"www.example.com\" prefix = url.split(\".\", maxsplit=1)[0] To access the last element, use str.rsplit() instead of str.split(): url = \"www.example.com\" suffix = url.rsplit(\".\", maxsplit=1)[-1] Fix Safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe for split()/rsplit() calls that contain *args or **kwargs arguments, as adding a maxsplit argument to such a call may lead to duplicated arguments.",
