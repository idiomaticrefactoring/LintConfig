  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unquoted-type-alias] [Message: Add quotes to type alias] What it does Checks if PEP 613 explicit type aliases contain references to symbols that are not available at runtime. Why is this bad? Referencing type-checking only symbols results in a NameError at runtime. Example from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeAlias if TYPE_CHECKING: from foo import Foo OptFoo: TypeAlias = Foo | None Use instead: from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, TypeAlias if TYPE_CHECKING: from foo import Foo OptFoo: TypeAlias = \"Foo | None\" Fix safety This rule's fix is currently always marked as unsafe, since runtime typing libraries may try to access/resolve the type alias in a way that we can't statically determine during analysis and relies on the type alias not containing any forward references.",
