  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-pyproject-toml] [Message: Failed to parse pyproject.toml: {message}] What it does Checks for any pyproject.toml that does not conform to the schema from the relevant PEPs. Why is this bad? Your project may contain invalid metadata or configuration without you noticing Example [project] name = \"crab\" version = \"1.0.0\" authors = [\"Ferris the Crab <[email protected]>\"] Use instead: [project] name = \"crab\" version = \"1.0.0\" authors = [ { name = \"Ferris the Crab\", email = \"[email protected]\" } ]",
  "option": {}
