  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: assignment-in-assert] [Message: Avoid assignment expressions in <code>assert</code> statements] What it does Checks for named assignment expressions (e.g., x := 0) in assert statements. Why is this bad? Named assignment expressions (also known as \"walrus operators\") are used to assign a value to a variable as part of a larger expression. Named assignments are syntactically valid in assert statements. However, when the Python interpreter is run under the -O flag, assert statements are not executed. In this case, the named assignment will also be ignored, which may result in unexpected behavior (e.g., undefined variable accesses). Example assert (x := 0) == 0 print(x) Use instead: x = 0 assert x == 0 print(x) The rule avoids flagging named expressions that define variables which are only referenced from inside assert statements; the following will not trigger the rule: assert (x := y**2) > 42, f\"Expected >42 but got {x}\" Nor will this: assert (x := y**2) > 42 assert x < 1_000_000",
