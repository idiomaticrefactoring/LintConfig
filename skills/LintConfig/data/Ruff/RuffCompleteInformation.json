Using this approach everywhere helps ensure consistency and clarity in defining dependencies and parameters.

Example from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI app = FastAPI() async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100): return {\"q\": q, \"skip\": skip, \"limit\": limit} @app.get(\"/items/\") async def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)): return commons Use instead: from typing import Annotated from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI app = FastAPI() async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100): return {\"q\": q, \"skip\": skip, \"limit\": limit} @app.get(\"/items/\") async def read_items(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]): return commons Fix safety This fix is always unsafe, as adding/removing/changing a function parameter's default value can change runtime behavior.

Why is this bad? Path parameters are used to extract values from the URL path. If a path parameter is declared in the route path but not in the function signature, it will not be accessible in the function body, which is likely a mistake.

Known problems If the path parameter is not a valid Python identifier (e.g., user-id, as opposed to user_id), FastAPI will normalize it.

For the purposes of this check, yield is considered a checkpoint, since checkpoints may occur in the caller to which we yield. Why is this bad? Some asynchronous context managers, such as asyncio.timeout and trio.move_on_after, have no effect unless they contain a checkpoint. The use of such context managers without an await, async with or async for statement is likely a mistake.

    "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: async-function-with-timeout] [Message: Async function definition with a <code>timeout</code> parameter] What it does Checks for async function definitions with timeout parameters. Why is this bad? Rather than implementing asynchronous timeout behavior manually, prefer built-in timeout functionality, such as asyncio.timeout, trio.fail_after, or anyio.move_on_after, among others. This rule is highly opinionated to enforce a design pattern called \"structured concurrency\" that allows for async functions to be oblivious to timeouts, instead letting callers to handle the logic with a context manager. Details This rule attempts to detect which async framework your code is using by analysing the imports in the file it's checking. If it sees an anyio import in your code, it will assume anyio is your framework of choice; if it sees a trio import, it will assume trio; if it sees neither, it will assume asyncio. asyncio.timeout was added in Python 3.11, so if asyncio is detected as the framework being used, this rule will be ignored when your configured target-version is set to less than Python 3.11. For functions that wrap asyncio.timeout, trio.fail_after or anyio.move_on_after, false positives from this rule can be avoided by using a different parameter name. Example async def long_running_task(timeout): ... async def main(): await long_running_task(timeout=2) Use instead: async def long_running_task(): ... async def main(): async with asyncio.timeout(2): await long_running_task()",

Why is this bad? Busy-waiting for a condition in a loop forces a tradeoff between efficiency and latency: shorter sleep times improve responsiveness but waste more CPU cycles, while longer sleep times reduce CPU usage but delay reaction to state changes. Waiting on an Event object like asyncio.Event, trio.Event, or anyio.Event eliminates this tradeoff, allowing immediate response with minimal wasted CPU time.

Why is this bad? Using return {value} in a generator function was syntactically invalid in Python 2. In Python 3 return {value} can be used in a generator; however, the combination of yield and return can lead to confusing behavior, as the return statement will cause the generator to raise StopIteration with the value provided, rather than returning the value to the caller. For example, given: from collections.abc import Iterable from pathlib import Path def get_file_paths(file_types: Iterable[str] | None = None) -> Iterable[Path]: dir_path = Path(\".\") if file_types is None: return dir_path.glob(\"*\") for file_type in file_types: yield from dir_path.glob(f\"*.{file_type}\") Readers might assume that get_file_paths() would return an iterable of Path objects in the directory; in reality, though, list(get_file_paths()) evaluates to [], since the return statement causes the generator to raise StopIteration with the value dir_path.glob(\"*\"): >>> list(get_file_paths(file_types=[\"cfg\", \"toml\"])) [PosixPath('setup.cfg'), PosixPath('pyproject.toml')] >>> list(get_file_paths()) [] For intentional uses of return in a generator, consider suppressing this diagnostic.

Example {a: b for a, b in iterable} [x for x in iterable] {x for x in iterable} Use instead: dict(iterable) list(iterable) set(iterable) Known problems This rule may produce false positives for dictionary comprehensions that iterate over a mapping. The dict constructor behaves differently depending on if it receives a sequence (e.g., a list) or a mapping (e.g., a dict). When a comprehension iterates over the keys of a mapping, replacing it with a dict() constructor call will give a different result. For example: >>> d1 = {(1, 2): 3, (4, 5): 6} >>> {x: y for x, y in d1} # Iterates over the keys of a mapping {1: 2, 4: 5} >>> dict(d1) # Ruff's incorrect suggested fix {(1, 2): 3, (4, 5): 6} >>> dict(d1.keys()) # Correct fix {1: 2, 4: 5} When the comprehension iterates over a sequence, Ruff's suggested fix is correct.

    "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unnecessary-comprehension-in-call] [Message: Unnecessary list comprehension] What it does Checks for unnecessary list or set comprehensions passed to builtin functions that take an iterable. Set comprehensions are only a violation in the case where the builtin function does not care about duplication of elements in the passed iterable. Why is this bad? Many builtin functions (this rule currently covers any and all in stable, along with min, max, and sum in preview) accept any iterable, including a generator. Constructing a temporary list via list comprehension is unnecessary and wastes memory for large iterables. any and all can also short-circuit iteration, saving a lot of time. The unnecessary comprehension forces a full iteration of the input iterable, giving up the benefits of short-circuiting. For example, compare the performance of all with a list comprehension against that of a generator in a case where an early short-circuit is possible (almost 40x faster): In [1]: %timeit all([i for i in range(1000)]) 8.14 µs ± 25.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each) In [2]: %timeit all(i for i in range(1000)) 212 ns ± 0.892 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each) This performance improvement is due to short-circuiting. If the entire iterable has to be traversed, the comprehension version may even be a bit faster: list allocation overhead is not necessarily greater than generator overhead. Applying this rule simplifies the code and will usually save memory, but in the absence of short-circuiting it may not improve performance. (It may even slightly regress performance, though the difference will usually be small.) Example any([x.id for x in bar]) all([x.id for x in bar]) sum([x.val for x in bar]) min([x.val for x in bar]) max([x.val for x in bar]) Use instead: any(x.id for x in bar) all(x.id for x in bar) sum(x.val for x in bar) min(x.val for x in bar) max(x.val for x in bar) Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it can change the behavior of the code if the iteration has side effects (due to laziness and short-circuiting).

Why is this bad? Python date objects are naive, that is, not timezone-aware. While an aware object represents a specific moment in time, a naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other datetime objects. Since this can lead to errors, it is recommended to always use timezone-aware objects. datetime.date.fromtimestamp(ts) returns a naive date object. Instead, use datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts, tz=...).date() to create a timezone-aware datetime object and retrieve its date component. Example import datetime datetime.date.fromtimestamp(946684800) Use instead: import datetime datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.timezone.utc).date() Or, for Python 3.11 and later: import datetime datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(946684800, tz=datetime.UTC).date()",

Why is this bad? PEP 585 enabled the use of a number of convenient type annotations, such as list[str] instead of List[str]. However, these annotations are only available on Python 3.9 and higher, unless the from __future__ import annotations import is present.

This rule thus pairs well with pyupgrade and with Ruff's pyupgrade rules. This rule respects the target-version setting.

Why is this bad? While the semantics are often identical, using Self is more intuitive and succinct (per PEP 673) than a custom TypeVar. For example, the use of Self will typically allow for the omission of type parameters on the self and cls arguments. This check currently applies to instance methods that return self, class methods that return an instance of cls, class methods that return cls, and __new__ methods. Example from typing import TypeVar _S = TypeVar(\"_S\", bound=\"Foo\") class Foo: def __new__(cls: type[_S], *args: str, **kwargs: int) -> _S: ... def foo(self: _S, arg: bytes) -> _S: ... @classmethod def bar(cls: type[_S], arg: int) -> _S: ...

Fix behaviour The fix replaces all references to the custom type variable in the method's header and body with references to Self. The fix also adds an import of Self if neither Self nor typing is already imported in the module. If your target-version setting is set to Python 3.11 or newer, the fix imports Self from the standard-library typing module; otherwise, the fix imports Self from the third-party typing_extensions backport package. If the custom type variable is a PEP-695-style TypeVar, the fix also removes the TypeVar declaration from the method's type parameter list. However, if the type variable is an old-style TypeVar, the declaration of the type variable will not be removed by this rule's fix, as the type variable could still be used by other functions, methods or classes. See unused-private-type-var for a rule that will clean up unused private type variables. Fix safety The fix is only marked as unsafe if there is the possibility that it might delete a comment from your code.

Why is this bad? The Python documentation recommends the use of object to \"indicate that a value could be any type in a typesafe manner\". Any, on the other hand, should be seen as an \"escape hatch when you need to mix dynamically and statically typed code\". Since using Any allows you to write highly unsafe code, you should generally only use Any when the semantics of your code would otherwise be inexpressible to the type checker. The expectation in Python is that a comparison of two arbitrary objects using == or != should never raise an exception. This contract can be fully expressed in the type system and does not involve requesting unsound behaviour from a type checker. As such, object is a more appropriate annotation than Any for the second parameter of the methods implementing these comparison operators -- __eq__ and __ne__.

Why is this bad? If methods that generally return self at runtime are annotated with a fixed return type, and the class is subclassed, type checkers will not be able to infer the correct return type. For example: class Shape: def set_scale(self, scale: float) -> Shape: self.scale = scale return self class Circle(Shape): def set_radius(self, radius: float) -> Circle: self.radius = radius return self # Type checker infers return type as `Shape`, not `Circle`. Circle().set_scale(0.5) # Thus, this expression is invalid, as `Shape` has no attribute `set_radius`. Circle().set_scale(0.5).set_radius(2.7) Specifically, this check enforces that the return type of the following methods is Self: In-place binary-operation dunder methods, like __iadd__, __imul__, etc. __new__, __enter__, and __aenter__, if those methods return the class name. __iter__ methods that return Iterator, despite the class inheriting directly from Iterator. __aiter__ methods that return AsyncIterator, despite the class inheriting directly from AsyncIterator. The rule attempts to avoid flagging methods on metaclasses, since PEP 673 specifies that Self is disallowed in metaclasses. Ruff can detect a class as being a metaclass if it inherits from a stdlib metaclass such as builtins.type or abc.ABCMeta, and additionally infers that a class may be a metaclass if it has a __new__ method with a similar signature to type.__new__. The heuristic used to identify a metaclass-like __new__ method signature is that it: Has exactly 5 parameters (including cls) Has a second parameter annotated with str Has a third parameter annotated with a tuple type Has a fourth parameter annotated with a dict type Has a fifth parameter is keyword-variadic (**kwargs) For example, the following class would be detected as a metaclass, disabling the rule: class MyMetaclass(django.db.models.base.ModelBase): def __new__(cls, name: str, bases: tuple[Any, ...], attrs: dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any) -> MyMetaclass: ...

Why is this bad? __iter__ methods should always should return an Iterator of some kind, not an Iterable. In Python, an Iterable is an object that has an __iter__ method; an Iterator is an object that has __iter__ and __next__ methods. All __iter__ methods are expected to return Iterators. Type checkers may not always recognize an object as being iterable if its __iter__ method does not return an Iterator. Every Iterator is an Iterable, but not every Iterable is an Iterator. For example, list is an Iterable, but not an Iterator; you can obtain an iterator over a list's elements by passing the list to iter(): >>> import collections.abc >>> x = [42] >>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterable) True >>> isinstance(x, collections.abc.Iterator) False >>> next(x) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator >>> y = iter(x) >>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterable) True >>> isinstance(y, collections.abc.Iterator) True >>> next(y) 42 Using Iterable rather than Iterator as a return type for an __iter__ methods would imply that you would not necessarily be able to call next() on the returned object, violating the expectations of the interface.

Why is this bad? Using (Async)Iterator for these methods is simpler and more elegant. More importantly, it also reflects the fact that the precise kind of iterator returned from an __iter__ method is usually an implementation detail that could change at any time.

Why is this bad? This rule helps enforce a consistent style across your codebase. It's often necessary to quote the first argument passed to cast(), as type expressions can involve forward references, or references to symbols which are only imported in typing.TYPE_CHECKING blocks. This can lead to a visual inconsistency across different cast() calls, where some type expressions are quoted but others are not. By enabling this rule, you ensure that all type expressions passed to cast() are quoted, enforcing stylistic consistency across all of your cast() calls. In some cases where cast() is used in a hot loop, this rule may also help avoid overhead from repeatedly evaluating complex type expressions at runtime. Example from typing import cast x = cast(dict[str, int], foo) Use instead: from typing import cast x = cast(\"dict[str, int]\", foo) Fix safety This fix is safe as long as the type expression doesn't span multiple lines and includes comments on any of the lines apart from the last one.",

    "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: quoted-type-alias] [Message: Remove quotes from type alias] What it does Checks for unnecessary quotes in PEP 613 explicit type aliases and PEP 695 type statements. Why is this bad? Unnecessary string forward references can lead to additional overhead in runtime libraries making use of type hints. They can also have bad interactions with other runtime uses like PEP 604 type unions. PEP-613 type aliases are only flagged by the rule if Ruff can have high confidence that the quotes are unnecessary. Specifically, any PEP-613 type alias where the type expression on the right-hand side contains subscripts or attribute accesses will not be flagged. This is because type aliases can reference types that are, for example, generic in stub files but not at runtime. That can mean that a type checker expects the referenced type to be subscripted with type arguments despite the fact that doing so would fail at runtime if the type alias value was not quoted. Similarly, a type alias might need to reference a module-level attribute that exists in a stub file but not at runtime, meaning that the type alias value would need to be quoted to avoid a runtime error. Example Given: from typing import TypeAlias OptInt: TypeAlias = \"int | None\" Use instead: from typing import TypeAlias OptInt: TypeAlias = int | None Given: type OptInt = \"int | None\" Use instead: type OptInt = int | None Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments.

Why is this bad? .nunique() is computationally inefficient for checking if a Series is constant. Consider, for example, a Series of length n that consists of increasing integer values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). The .nunique() method will iterate over the entire Series to count the number of unique values. But in this case, we can detect that the Series is non-constant after visiting the first two values, which are non-equal. In general, .nunique() requires iterating over the entire Series, while a more efficient approach allows short-circuiting the operation as soon as a non-equal value is found. Instead of calling .nunique(), convert the Series to a NumPy array, and check if all values in the array are equal to the first observed value. Example import pandas as pd data = pd.Series(range(1000)) if data.nunique() <= 1: print(\"Series is constant\") Use instead: import pandas as pd data = pd.Series(range(1000)) array = data.to_numpy() if array.shape[0] == 0 or (array[0] == array).all(): print(\"Series is constant\")",

Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged. When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object-oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket). Further, in order for Python modules to be importable, they must be valid identifiers. As such, they cannot start with a digit, or collide with hard keywords, like import or class.

Why is this bad? Exception handling via try-except blocks incurs some performance overhead, regardless of whether an exception is raised. To optimize your code, two techniques are possible: Refactor your code to put the entire loop into the try-except block, rather than wrapping each iteration in a separate try-except block. Use \"Look Before You Leap\" idioms that attempt to avoid exceptions being raised in the first place, avoiding the need to use try-except blocks in the first place. This rule is only enforced for Python versions prior to 3.11, which introduced \"zero-cost\" exception handling. However, note that even on Python 3.11 and newer, refactoring your code to avoid exception handling in tight loops can provide a significant speedup in some cases, as zero-cost exception handling is only zero-cost in the \"happy path\" where no exception is raised in the try-except block. As with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a micro-optimization. In many cases, it will have a negligible impact on performance. Example string_numbers: list[str] = [\"1\", \"2\", \"three\", \"4\", \"5\"] # `try`/`except` that could be moved out of the loop: int_numbers: list[int] = [] for num in string_numbers: try: int_numbers.append(int(num)) except ValueError as e: print(f\"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}\") break # `try`/`except` used when \"look before you leap\" idioms could be used: number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: \"one\", 3: \"three\", 4: \"four\"} for number in range(5): try: name = number_names[number] except KeyError: continue else: print(f\"The name of {number} is {name}\") Use instead: string_numbers: list[str] = [\"1\", \"2\", \"three\", \"4\", \"5\"] int_numbers: list[int] = [] try: for num in string_numbers: int_numbers.append(int(num)) except ValueError as e: print(f\"Couldn't convert to integer: {e}\") number_names: dict[int, str] = {1: \"one\", 3: \"three\", 4: \"four\"} for number in range(5): name = number_names.get(number) if name is not None: print(f\"The name of {number} is {name}\")",

Why is this bad? Overlong lines can hurt readability. PEP 8, for example, recommends limiting lines to 79 characters. By default, this rule enforces a limit of 88 characters for compatibility with Black and the Ruff formatter, though that limit is configurable via the line-length setting. In the interest of pragmatism, this rule makes a few exceptions when determining whether a line is overlong. Namely, it: Ignores lines that consist of a single \"word\" (i.e., without any whitespace between its characters). Ignores lines that end with a URL, as long as the URL starts before the line-length threshold. Ignores line that end with a pragma comment (e.g., # type: ignore or # noqa), as long as the pragma comment starts before the line-length threshold. That is, a line will not be flagged as overlong if a pragma comment causes it to exceed the line length. (This behavior aligns with that of the Ruff formatter.) Ignores SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices (e.g., # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT), which are machine-readable and should not wrap over multiple lines. If lint.pycodestyle.ignore-overlong-task-comments is true, this rule will also ignore comments that start with any of the specified lint.task-tags (e.g., # TODO:). Example my_function(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7, param8, param9, param10) Use instead: my_function( param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7, param8, param9, param10 ) Error suppression Hint: when suppressing E501 errors within multi-line strings (like docstrings), the noqa directive should come at the end of the string (after the closing triple quote), and will apply to the entire string, like so: \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

    "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: doc-line-too-long] [Message: Doc line too long ({width} > {limit})] What it does Checks for doc lines that exceed the specified maximum character length. Why is this bad? For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments), overlong lines can hurt readability. PEP 8, for example, recommends that such lines be limited to 72 characters, while this rule enforces the limit specified by the lint.pycodestyle.max-doc-length setting. (If no value is provided, this rule will be ignored, even if it's added to your --select list.) In the context of this rule, a \"doc line\" is defined as a line consisting of either a standalone comment or a standalone string, like a docstring. In the interest of pragmatism, this rule makes a few exceptions when determining whether a line is overlong. Namely, it: Ignores lines that consist of a single \"word\" (i.e., without any whitespace between its characters). Ignores lines that end with a URL, as long as the URL starts before the line-length threshold. Ignores line that end with a pragma comment (e.g., # type: ignore or # noqa), as long as the pragma comment starts before the line-length threshold. That is, a line will not be flagged as overlong if a pragma comment causes it to exceed the line length. (This behavior aligns with that of the Ruff formatter.) If lint.pycodestyle.ignore-overlong-task-comments is true, this rule will also ignore comments that start with any of the specified lint.task-tags (e.g., # TODO:). Example def function(x): \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis auctor purus ut ex fermentum, at maximus est hendrerit.\"\"\" Use instead: def function(x): \"\"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis auctor purus ut ex fermentum, at maximus est hendrerit. \"\"\" Error suppression Hint: when suppressing W505 errors within multi-line strings (like docstrings), the noqa directive should come at the end of the string (after the closing triple quote), and will apply to the entire string, like so: \"\"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

    "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: unused-import] [Message: <code>{name}</code> imported but unused; consider using <code>importlib.util.find_spec</code> to test for availability] What it does Checks for unused imports. Why is this bad? Unused imports add a performance overhead at runtime, and risk creating import cycles. They also increase the cognitive load of reading the code. If an import statement is used to check for the availability or existence of a module, consider using importlib.util.find_spec instead. If an import statement is used to re-export a symbol as part of a module's public interface, consider using a \"redundant\" import alias, which instructs Ruff (and other tools) to respect the re-export, and avoid marking it as unused, as in: from module import member as member Alternatively, you can use __all__ to declare a symbol as part of the module's interface, as in: # __init__.py import some_module __all__ = [\"some_module\"] Preview When preview is enabled (and certain simplifying assumptions are met), we analyze all import statements for a given module when determining whether an import is used, rather than simply the last of these statements. This can result in both different and more import statements being marked as unused. For example, if a module consists of import a import a.b then both statements are marked as unused under preview, whereas only the second is marked as unused under stable behavior. As another example, if a module consists of import a.b import a a.b.foo() then a diagnostic will only be emitted for the first line under preview, whereas a diagnostic would only be emitted for the second line under stable behavior. Note that this behavior is somewhat subjective and is designed to conform to the developer's intuition rather than Python's actual execution. To wit, the statement import a.b automatically executes import a, so in some sense import a is always redundant in the presence of import a.b. Fix safety Fixes to remove unused imports are safe, except in __init__.py files. Applying fixes to __init__.py files is currently in preview. The fix offered depends on the type of the unused import. Ruff will suggest a safe fix to export first-party imports with either a redundant alias or, if already present in the file, an __all__ entry. If multiple __all__ declarations are present, Ruff will not offer a fix. Ruff will suggest an unsafe fix to remove third-party and standard library imports -- the fix is unsafe because the module's interface changes. See this FAQ section for more details on how Ruff determines whether an import is first or third-party. Example import numpy as np # unused import def area(radius): return 3.14 * radius**2 Use instead: def area(radius): return 3.14 * radius**2 To check the availability of a module, use importlib.util.find_spec: from importlib.util import find_spec if find_spec(\"numpy\") is not None: print(\"numpy is installed\") else: print(\"numpy is not installed\")",

Why is this bad? By default, Python's generic types are invariant, but can be marked as either covariant or contravariant via the covariant and contravariant keyword arguments. While the API does allow you to mark a type as both covariant and contravariant, this is not supported by the type system, and should be avoided. Instead, change the variance of the type to be either covariant, contravariant, or invariant. If you want to describe both covariance and contravariance, consider using two separate type parameters. For context: an \"invariant\" generic type only accepts values that exactly match the type parameter; for example, list[Dog] accepts only list[Dog], not list[Animal] (superclass) or list[Bulldog] (subclass). This is the default behavior for Python's generic types. A \"covariant\" generic type accepts subclasses of the type parameter; for example, Sequence[Animal] accepts Sequence[Dog]. A \"contravariant\" generic type accepts superclasses of the type parameter; for example, Callable[Dog] accepts Callable[Animal]. Example from typing import TypeVar T = TypeVar(\"T\", covariant=True, contravariant=True) Use instead: from typing import TypeVar T_co = TypeVar(\"T_co\", covariant=True) T_contra = TypeVar(\"T_contra\", contravariant=True)",

Why is this bad? In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the attributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python uses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory overhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact internal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory savings. Any string iterable may be assigned to __slots__ (most commonly, a tuple of strings). If a string is assigned to __slots__, it is interpreted as a single attribute name, rather than an iterable of attribute names. This can cause confusion, as users that iterate over the __slots__ value may expect to iterate over a sequence of attributes, but would instead iterate over the characters of the string. To use a single string attribute in __slots__, wrap the string in an iterable container type, like a tuple. Example class Person: __slots__: str = \"name\" def __init__(self, name: str) -> None: self.name = name Use instead: class Person: __slots__: tuple[str, ...] = (\"name\",) def __init__(self, name: str) -> None: self.name = name",

This rule will try to determine if the values are hashable and the fix will use a set if they are. If unable to determine, the fix will use a tuple and suggest the use of a set. Why is this bad? To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, it is common to write a series of equality comparisons (e.g., foo == \"bar\" or foo == \"baz\").

Fix safety This fix is always unsafe. When replacing exit or quit with sys.exit, the behavior can change in the following ways: If the code runs in an environment where the site module is not imported (e.g., with python -S), the original code would raise a NameError, while the fixed code would execute normally. site.exit and sys.exit handle tuple arguments differently. site.exit treats tuples as regular objects and always returns exit code 1, while sys.exit interprets tuple contents to determine the exit code: an empty tuple () results in exit code 0, and a single-element tuple like (2,) uses that element's value (2) as the exit code.

If the right-hand side of an assignment statement consists of a binary operation in which one operand is the same as the assignment target, it can be rewritten as an augmented assignment. For example, x = x + 1 can be rewritten as x += 1. When performing such an operation, an augmented assignment is more concise and idiomatic. Known problems In some cases, this rule will not detect assignments in which the target is on the right-hand side of a binary operation (e.g., x = y + x, as opposed to x = x + y), as such operations are not commutative for certain data types, like strings. For example, x = \"prefix-\" + x is not equivalent to x += \"prefix-\", while x = 1 + x is equivalent to x += 1. If the type of the left-hand side cannot be trivially inferred, the rule will ignore the assignment. Example x = x + 1 Use instead: x += 1 Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as augmented assignments have different semantics when the target is a mutable data type, like a list or dictionary.

Why is this bad? Redefinition of a loop variable inside the loop's body causes its value to differ from the original loop iteration for the remainder of the block, in a way that will likely cause bugs. In Python, unlike many other languages, for loops and with statements don't define their own scopes. Therefore, a nested loop that uses the same target variable name as an outer loop will reuse the same actual variable, and the value from the last iteration will \"leak out\" into the remainder of the enclosing loop. While this mistake is easy to spot in small examples, it can be hidden in larger blocks of code, where the definition and redefinition of the variable may not be visible at the same time. Example for i in range(10): i = 9 print(i) # prints 9 every iteration for i in range(10): for i in range(10): # original value overwritten pass print(i) # also prints 9 every iteration with path1.open() as f: with path2.open() as f: f = path2.open() print(f.readline()) # prints a line from path2",

Why is this bad? PEP 585 enabled collections in the Python standard library (like list) to be used as generics directly, instead of importing analogous members from the typing module (like typing.List). When available, the PEP 585 syntax should be used instead of importing members from the typing module, as it's more concise and readable. Importing those members from typing is considered deprecated as of PEP 585. This rule is enabled when targeting Python 3.9 or later (see: target-version).

Why is this bad? The type keyword was introduced in Python 3.12 by PEP 695 for defining type aliases. The type keyword is easier to read and provides cleaner support for generics. Known problems PEP 695 uses inferred variance for type parameters, instead of the covariant and contravariant keywords used by TypeVar variables. As such, rewriting a type alias using a PEP-695 type statement may change the variance of the alias's type parameters. Unlike type aliases that use simple assignments, definitions created using PEP 695 type statements cannot be used as drop-in replacements at runtime for the value on the right-hand side of the statement. This means that while for some simple old-style type aliases you can use them as the second argument to an isinstance() call (for example), doing the same with a PEP 695 type statement will always raise TypeError at runtime. Example from typing import Annotated, TypeAlias, TypeAliasType from annotated_types import Gt ListOfInt: TypeAlias = list[int] PositiveInt = TypeAliasType(\"PositiveInt\", Annotated[int, Gt(0)]) Use instead: from typing import Annotated from annotated_types import Gt type ListOfInt = list[int] type PositiveInt = Annotated[int, Gt(0)] Fix safety This fix is marked unsafe for TypeAlias assignments outside of stub files because of the runtime behavior around isinstance() calls noted above.

See non-pep695-generic-class and non-pep695-generic-function for similar transformations for generic classes and functions.

If your code relies on runtime type annotations (either directly or via a library like Pydantic), you can disable this behavior for Python versions prior to 3.10 by setting lint.pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing to true. Example from typing import Optional foo: Optional[int] = None Use instead: foo: int | None = None Fix safety This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may lead to runtime errors using libraries that rely on runtime type annotations, like Pydantic, on Python versions prior to Python 3.10, or as it may remove comments if they are present within the type annotation being rewritten. It may also lead to runtime errors in unusual and likely incorrect type annotations where the type does not support the | operator.",

Why is this bad? The operator module provides functions that implement the same functionality as the corresponding operators. For example, operator.add is often equivalent to lambda x, y: x + y. Using the functions from the operator module is more concise and communicates the intent of the code more clearly. Example import functools nums = [1, 2, 3] total = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums) Use instead: import functools import operator nums = [1, 2, 3] total = functools.reduce(operator.add, nums) Fix safety The fix offered by this rule is always marked as unsafe. While the changes the fix would make would rarely break your code, there are two ways in which functions from the operator module differ from user-defined functions. It would be non-trivial for Ruff to detect whether or not these differences would matter in a specific situation where Ruff is emitting a diagnostic for this rule. The first difference is that operator functions cannot be called with keyword arguments, but most user-defined functions can. If an add function is defined as add = lambda x, y: x + y, replacing this function with operator.add will cause the later call to raise TypeError if the function is later called with keyword arguments, e.g. add(x=1, y=2). The second difference is that user-defined functions are descriptors, but this is not true of the functions defined in the operator module. Practically speaking, this means that defining a function in a class body (either by using a def statement or assigning a lambda function to a variable) is a valid way of defining an instance method on that class; monkeypatching a user-defined function onto a class after the class has been created also has the same effect. The same is not true of an operator function: assigning an operator function to a variable in a class body or monkeypatching one onto a class will not create a valid instance method. Ruff will refrain from emitting diagnostics for this rule on function definitions in class bodies; however, it does not currently have sophisticated enough type inference to avoid emitting this diagnostic if a user-defined function is being monkeypatched onto a class after the class has been constructed.",

Example for index, _ in enumerate(sequence): print(index) for _, value in enumerate(sequence): print(value) Use instead: for index in range(len(sequence)): print(index) for value in sequence: print(value)",

This can lead to bugs when the attributes are changed in one instance, as those changes will unexpectedly affect all other instances. Generally speaking, you probably want to avoid having mutable default values in the class body at all; instead, these variables should usually be initialized in __init__.

Implicit Optional is prohibited by PEP 484. It is confusing and inconsistent with the rest of the type system. It's recommended to use Optional[T] instead.

For example, it's common to initialize a defaultdict with int or list via defaultdict(int) or defaultdict(list), to create a dictionary that returns 0 or [] respectively when a key is missing. The default factory must be provided as a positional argument, as all keyword arguments to defaultdict are interpreted as initial entries in the dictionary.

By default, \"dummy variables\" are any variables with names that start with leading underscores. However, this is customisable using the lint.dummy-variable-rgx setting). Why is this bad? Marking a variable with a leading underscore conveys that it is intentionally unused within the function or method. When these variables are later referenced in the code, it causes confusion and potential misunderstandings about the code's intention. If a variable marked as \"unused\" is subsequently used, it suggests that either the variable could be given a clearer name, or that the code is accidentally making use of the wrong variable. Sometimes leading underscores are used to avoid variables shadowing other variables, Python builtins, or Python keywords. However, PEP 8 recommends to use trailing underscores for this rather than leading underscores. Dunder variables are ignored by this rule, as are variables named _. Only local variables in function scopes are flagged by the rule. Example def function(): _variable = 3 # important: avoid shadowing the builtin `id()` function! _id = 4 return _variable + _id Use instead: def function(): variable = 3 # important: avoid shadowing the builtin `id()` function! id_ = 4 return variable + id_ Fix availability The rule's fix is only available for variables that start with leading underscores.

Therefore, it is better to use dedicated library functions like annotationlib.get_annotations (Python 3.14+), inspect.get_annotations (Python 3.10+), or typing_extensions.get_annotations (for Python < 3.10 if typing-extensions is available). The benefits of using these functions include: Avoiding Undocumented Internals: They provide a stable, public API, unlike direct __dict__ access which relies on implementation details. Forward-Compatibility: They are designed to handle changes in Python's annotation system across versions, ensuring your code remains robust (e.g., correctly handling the Python 3.14 behavior mentioned above). See Python Annotations Best Practices for alternatives. Example foo.__dict__.get(\"__annotations__\", {}) # or foo.__dict__[\"__annotations__\"] On Python 3.14+, use instead: import annotationlib annotationlib.get_annotations(foo) On Python 3.10+, use instead: import inspect inspect.get_annotations(foo) On Python < 3.10 with typing-extensions installed, use instead: import typing_extensions typing_extensions.get_annotations(foo) Fix safety No autofix is currently provided for this rule.

    "description": "[Status: preview] [Name: non-octal-permissions] [Message: Non-octal mode] What it does Checks for standard library functions which take a numeric mode argument where a non-octal integer literal is passed. Why is this bad? Numeric modes are made up of one to four octal digits. Converting a non-octal integer to octal may not be the mode the author intended. Example os.chmod(\"foo\", 644) Use instead: os.chmod(\"foo\", 0o644) Fix safety There are two categories of fix, the first of which is where it looks like the author intended to use an octal literal but the 0o prefix is missing: os.chmod(\"foo\", 400) os.chmod(\"foo\", 644) This class of fix changes runtime behaviour. In the first case, 400 corresponds to 0o620 (u=rw,g=w,o=). As this mode is not deemed likely, it is changed to 0o400 (u=r,go=). Similarly, 644 corresponds to 0o1204 (u=ws,g=,o=r) and is changed to 0o644 (u=rw,go=r). The second category is decimal literals which are recognised as likely valid but in decimal form: os.chmod(\"foo\", 256) os.chmod(\"foo\", 493) 256 corresponds to 0o400 (u=r,go=) and 493 corresponds to 0o755 (u=rwx,go=rx). Both of these fixes keep runtime behavior unchanged. If the original code really intended to use 0o256 (u=w,g=rx,o=rw) instead of 256, this fix should not be accepted. As a special case, zero is allowed to omit the 0o prefix unless it has multiple digits: os.chmod(\"foo\", 0) # Ok os.chmod(\"foo\", 0o000) # Ok os.chmod(\"foo\", 000) # Lint emitted and fix suggested Ruff will suggest a safe fix for multi-digit zeros to add the 0o prefix. Fix availability A fix is only available if the integer literal matches a set of common modes.",
