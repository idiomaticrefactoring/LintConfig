Progress is being tracked in the following GitHub issue:https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1274Currently, utility class sorting isnot part of the formatter, and is implemented as a linter rule instead, with an automatic fix. The fix is, at this stage, classified as unsafe. This means thatit won’t be applied automaticallyas part of IDE actions such as “fix on save”.We appreciate any feedback on this rule, and encourage you to try it out and report any issues you find.Please read this entire documentation page before reporting an issue.Notably, keep in mind that the following features are not supported yet:Screen variant sorting (e.g.md:,max-lg:). Only static, dynamic and arbitrary variants are supported.Custom utilitites and variants (such as ones introduced by Tailwind CSS plugins). Only the default Tailwind CSS configuration is supported.Options such asprefixandseparator.Object properties (e.g. inclsxcalls).Please don’t report issues about these features.",
