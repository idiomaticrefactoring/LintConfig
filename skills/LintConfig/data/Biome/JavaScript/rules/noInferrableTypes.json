        "description": "Description\n\nDisallow type annotations for variables, parameters, and class properties initialized with a literal expression.\nTypeScript is able to infer the types of parameters, properties, and variables from their default or initial values.\nThere is no need to use an explicit:type annotation for trivially inferred types (boolean, bigint, number, regex, string).\nDoing so adds unnecessary verbosity to code making it harder to read.\nIn contrast to ESLint’s rule, this rule allows to use a wide type forconstdeclarations.\nMoreover, the rule does not recognizeundefinedvalues, primitive type constructors (String, Number, …), andRegExptype.\nThese global variables could be shadowed by local ones.",
