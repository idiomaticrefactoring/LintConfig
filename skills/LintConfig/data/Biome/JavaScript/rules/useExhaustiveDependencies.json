        "option": "hooksSection titled “hooks”\nAllows specifying custom hooks (from libraries or internal projects) whose dependencies\nshould be checked and/or which are known to have stable return values.\nFor every hook whose dependencies you want validated, you must specify the index of both the closure\nusing the dependencies and the dependencies array to validate it against.\nExampleSection titled “Example”\nbiome.json\n1{2  \"linter\": {3    \"rules\": {4      \"correctness\": {5        \"useExhaustiveDependencies\": {6          \"options\": {7            \"hooks\": [8              {9                \"name\": \"useLocation\",10                \"closureIndex\": 0,11                \"dependenciesIndex\": 112              },13              {14                \"name\": \"useQuery\",15                \"closureIndex\": 2,16                \"dependenciesIndex\": 017              }18            ]19          }20        }21      }22    }23  }24}\nThis would enable checks on the following code snippets:\n\n1function Foo() {2  let stateVar = 1;3  useLocation(() => {console.log(stateVar)}, []);4}\ncode-block.js:3:3lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependenciesFIXABLE━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━✖This hookdoes not specifyits dependency onstateVar.1 │function Foo() {2 │let stateVar = 1;>3 │useLocation(() => {console.log(stateVar)}, []);│^^^^^^^^^^^4 │}5 │ℹThis dependency is being used here, but is not specified in the hook dependency list.1 │function Foo() {2 │let stateVar = 1;>3 │useLocation(() => {console.log(stateVar)}, []);│^^^^^^^^4 │}5 │ℹReact relies on hook dependencies to determine when to re-compute Effects.Failing to specify dependencies can result in Effectsnot updating correctlywhen state changes.These “stale closures” are a common source of surprising bugs.ℹEither include it or remove the dependency array.ℹUnsafe fix:Add the missing dependency to the list.3 │··useLocation(()·=>·{console.log(stateVar)},·[stateVar]);│++++++++\n\n1function Foo() {2  let stateVar = 1;3  useQuery([stateVar], \"smthng\", () => {console.log(stateVar)});4}\nConfiguring stable resultsSection titled “Configuring stable results”\nAs previously discussed, the lint rule takes into account so-calledstable resultsand will ensure any such variables arenotspecified as dependencies.\nYou can specify custom functions as returning stable results in one of four ways:\n\"stableResult\": true— marks the return value as stable. An example\nof a React hook that would be configured like this isuseRef().\"stableResult\": [1]— expects the return value to be an array and\nmarks the given indices as stable. An example of a React\nhook that would be configured like this isuseState().\"stableResult\": 1— shorthand for option 2 (\"stableResult\": [1]).\nUseful for hooks that only have a single stable return.\"stableResult\": [\"setValue\"]— expects the return value to be an\nobject and marks the properties with the given keys as stable.\nExampleSection titled “Example”\nbiome.json\n1{2  \"linter\": {3    \"rules\": {4      \"correctness\": {5        \"useExhaustiveDependencies\": {6          \"options\": {7            \"hooks\": [8              {9                \"name\": \"useDispatch\",10                \"stableResult\": true11              }12            ]13          }14        }15      }16    }17  }18}\nWith this configuration, the following is valid:\n\n1const dispatch = useDispatch();2// No need to list `dispatch` as dependency since it doesn't change3const doAction = useCallback(() => dispatch(someAction()), []);\nreportUnnecessaryDependenciesSection titled “reportUnnecessaryDependencies”\nIf set tofalse, the rule will not trigger diagnostics for unused dependencies passed to hooks that do not use them.\nCautionOver-specifying dependencies can reduce application performance or even cause infinite loops, so caution is advised.\nDefault:true\nExampleSection titled “Example”\nbiome.json\n1{2  \"linter\": {3    \"rules\": {4      \"correctness\": {5        \"useExhaustiveDependencies\": {6          \"options\": {7            \"reportUnnecessaryDependencies\": false8          }9        }10      }11    }12  }13}\n\n1import { useEffect } from \"react\";2\n3function Foo() {4  let stateVar = 1;5  // not used but still OK6  useEffect(() => {}, [stateVar]);7}\nreportMissingDependenciesArraySection titled “reportMissingDependenciesArray”\nIf enabled, the rule will also trigger diagnostics for hooks that lack dependency arrays altogether,\nrequiring any hooks lacking dependencies to explicitly specify an empty array.\nDefault:false\nExampleSection titled “Example”\nbiome.json\n1{2  \"linter\": {3    \"rules\": {4      \"correctness\": {5        \"useExhaustiveDependencies\": {6          \"options\": {7            \"reportMissingDependenciesArray\": true8          }9        }10      }11    }12  }13}\n\n1function noArrayYesProblem() {2  let stateVar = 1;3  React.useEffect(() => {});4}\ncode-block.jsx:3:9lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━✖This hook does not have a dependencies array.1 │function noArrayYesProblem() {2 │let stateVar = 1;>3 │React.useEffect(() => {});│^^^^^^^^^4 │}5 │ℹReact relies on hook dependencies to determine when to re-compute Effects.Add an explicit array (i.e.[]) and list the callback’s dependencies inside it."
