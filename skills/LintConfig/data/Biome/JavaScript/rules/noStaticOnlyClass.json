Doing so is generally unnecessary in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.\nWrapper classes add extra cognitive complexity to code without adding any structural improvements\n\nWhatever would be put on them, such as utility functions, are already organized by virtue of being in a module.\nAs an alternative, you can import * as … the module to get all of them in a single object.\nWhatever would be put on them, such as utility functions, are already organized by virtue of being in a module.\nAs an alternative, you can import * as … the module to get all of them in a single object.\nIDEs can’t provide as good suggestions for static class or namespace imported properties when you start typing property names\nIt’s more difficult to statically analyze code for unused variables, etc. when they’re all on the class (see: Finding dead code (and dead types) in TypeScript).",
