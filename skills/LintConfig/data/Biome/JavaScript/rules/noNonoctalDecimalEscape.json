For example:\n\n1\"\\8\" === \"8\"; // true2\"\\9\" === \"9\"; // true\nAlthough this syntax is deprecated, it is still supported for compatibility reasons.\nIf the ECMAScript host is not a web browser, this syntax is optional.\nHowever, web browsers are still required to support it, but only in non-strict mode.\nRegardless of your targeted environment, it is recommended to avoid using these escape sequences in new code.",
