However, this is usually a mistake, for a few reasons:\nIf an async executor function throws an error, the error will be lost and won’t cause the newly-constructedPromiseto reject. This could make it difficult to debug and handle some errors.If a Promise executor function is usingawait, this is usually a sign that it is not actually necessary to use thenew Promiseconstructor, or the scope of thenew Promiseconstructor can be reduced.",
