This is clear for function\ncalls and assignments, because the call or the assignment itself is the\nprimary intention behind the statement. For other expression kinds, the\nintention is much more ambiguous; it could be the expression contains\nside-effects that are not very explicit, but it could also be that it is\nan error where the author forgot to use the result of the expression,\nsuch as a forgottenreturnkeyword, or it could point to a function\nthat the author forgot to call.",
