        "description": "Description\n\nEnforce thatnew Error()is thrown with the original error ascause.\nWhen catching and rethrowing an error, it’s recommended to wrap the original error in a newErrorobject to preserve the original error’s stack trace and context. The original error should be passed as thecauseproperty of the newErrorobject.\nThis rule enforces that practice, helping to maintain a clear and traceable error propagation chain, which is crucial for effective debugging.",
