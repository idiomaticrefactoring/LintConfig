So, if you see them in a pattern (called a regular expression), it’s probably a mistake.\nThe following elements of regular expression patterns are considered possible errors in typing and are therefore disallowed by this rule:\nHexadecimal character escapes from \\x00 to \\x1F\nUnicode character escapes from \\u0000 to \\u001F\nUnicode code point escapes from \\u{0} to \\u{1F}\nUnescaped raw characters from U+0000 to U+001F\nControl escapes such as\\tand\\nare allowed by this rule.",
