        "description": "Description\n\nDisallow the use of configured elements.\nThis rule disallows the use of configured elements. Without elements configured,\nthis rule doesn’t do anything.\nThis rule is useful in situations where you want to enforce the use of specific components\ninstead of certain HTML or custom elements. For example, in a React project,\nyou might want to ensure that developers use a customTextFieldcomponent\ninstead of the native<input>element to maintain consistency and apply\ncustom styling or behavior.\nHere are some scenarios where this rule can be beneficial:\nConsistency: Ensuring that all input fields use a custom component instead of the native\nelement to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.\nAccessibility: Enforcing the use of custom components that have built-in\naccessibility features, ensuring that the application is accessible to all users.\nCustom Behavior: Requiring the use of components that encapsulate specific business logic\nor validation, reducing the risk of errors and improving code maintainability.\nStyling: Ensuring that all elements adhere to the design system by using\ncustom components that apply consistent styling.\nBy disallowing certain elements and enforcing the use of custom components,\nthis rule helps maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.",
