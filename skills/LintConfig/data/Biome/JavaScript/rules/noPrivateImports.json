Unfortunately,\nthis makes it hard to enforce module boundaries, or to prevent importing\nthings that were only exported for test purposes, for instance.\nThis rule recognizes the JSDoc tags@public,@package, and@privateso that you are free to set the visibility of exports.\nExports without tag have a default visibility ofpublic, but this\ncan be configured.\nThe@accesstag is also supported if it’s used with one of the valuespublic,package, orprivate.",
