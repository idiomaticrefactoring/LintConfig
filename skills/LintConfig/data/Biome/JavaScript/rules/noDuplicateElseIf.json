        "description": "Description\n\nDisallow duplicate conditions in if-else-if chains\nif-else-if chains are commonly used when there is a need to execute only one branch\n(or at most one branch) out of several possible branches, based on certain conditions.\nTwo identical test conditions in the same chain are almost always a mistake in the code.\nUnless there are side effects in the expressions,\na duplicate will evaluate to the same true or false value as the identical expression earlier in the chain,\nmeaning that its branch can never execute.\nPlease note that this rule does not compare conditions from the chain with conditions inside statements",
