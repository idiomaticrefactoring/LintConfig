  "description": "An _Uncommunicative Variable Name_ is a variable name that doesn't communicate\nits intent well enough. This code smell is a case of\n[Uncommunicative Name](Uncommunicative-Name.md).",
  "configuration_docs": "Reek's _Uncommunicative Variable Name_ detector supports the\n[Basic Smell Options](Basic-Smell-Options.md), plus:\n| Option         | Value       | Effect  |\n| ---------------|-------------|---------|\n| `reject` | array of strings | The set of names that Reek uses to check for bad names. Defaults to single-letter names, names ending with a number or names containing upper case letters. |\n| `accept` | array of strings | Names that will be accepted (not reported) even if they match one of the `reject` expressions. Defaults to `_`.|\nAn example configuration could look like this:\n```yaml\n---\nUncommunicativeVariableName:\naccept:\n- x\n- var1\nreject:\n- helper\n- foobar\n```\nReek will convert whatever you give it as a string to the corresponding regex, so \"foobar\" from above will be converted to /foobar/ internally.\nApplying a configuration to a source file like this:\n```ruby\ndef omg\nx = 5 # Should not be reported\nvar1 = true # Should not be reported\nhelper = 42 # Should be reported\nfoobar = false # Should be reported\nend\n```\nReek would report:\n```\nsmelly.rb -- 2 warnings:\n[5]:UncommunicativeVariableName: omg has the variable name 'foobar' [https://github.com/troessner/reek/blob/master/docs/Uncommunicative-Variable-Name.md]\n[4]:UncommunicativeVariableName: omg has the variable name 'helper' [https://github.com/troessner/reek/blob/master/docs/Uncommunicative-Variable-Name.md]\n```\nSometimes just strings are not enough for configuration. E.g. consider this code sample:\n```ruby\ndef omg\nfoo = 42\nfoobar = 4242\nend\n```\nand now imagine that you want to reject the name \"foo\" but not \"foobar\". This wouldn't be possible with just using strings.\nFor this reason Reek has a special syntax that allows you to use regexes by using a forward slash at the beginning and the end of the string.\nEverything within the forward slashes will be loaded as a regex.\nA possible configuration that allows \"foobar\" but rejects \"foo\" could look like this:\n```yaml\n---\nUncommunicativeVariableName:\nreject:\n- \"/^foo$/\"\n```",
