  "description": "In general, a _Data Clump_ occurs when the same two or three items frequently\nappear together in classes and parameter lists, or when a group of instance\nvariable names start or end with similar substrings.\nThe recurrence of the items often means there is duplicate code spread around to handle them. There may be an abstraction missing from the code, making the system harder to understand.",
  "configuration_docs": "Reek's _Data Clump_ detector offers the [Basic Smell Options](Basic-Smell-Options.md), plus:\n| Option           | Value       | Effect  |\n| -----------------|-------------|---------|\n| `max_copies`     | integer | The maximum number of methods that are permitted to take the same group of parameters.
