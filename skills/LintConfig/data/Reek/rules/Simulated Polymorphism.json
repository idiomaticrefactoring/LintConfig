        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nSimulated Polymorphism occurs when\n\ncode uses a case statement (especially on a type field);\nor code has several if statements in a row (especially if they're comparing against the same value);\nor code uses instance_of?, kind_of?, is_a?, or === to decide what type it's working with;\nor multiple conditionals in different places test the same value.\n\nConditional code is hard to read and understand, because the reader must hold more state in their head. When the same value is tested in multiple places throughout an application, any change to the set of possible values will require many methods and classes to change. Tests for the type of an object may indicate that the abstraction represented by that type is not completely defined (or understood).\n\nCurrent Support in Reek\n\nReek checks for Manual Dispatch, Repeated Conditional  and for Nil Check.",
