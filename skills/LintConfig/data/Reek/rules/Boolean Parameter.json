        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nBoolean Parameter is a case of Control Couple, where a\nmethod parameter is defaulted to true or false. A Boolean Parameter\neffectively permits a method's caller to decide which execution path to take.\nThis is a case of bad cohesion. You're creating a dependency between methods\nthat is not really necessary, thus increasing coupling.\n\nExample\n\nGiven\n\nruby\nclass Dummy\n  def hit_the_switch(switch = true)\n    if switch\n      puts 'Hitting the switch'\n      # do other things...\n    else\n      puts 'Not hitting the switch'\n      # do other things...\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nReek would emit the following warning:\n\ntest.rb -- 3 warnings:\n  [1]:Dummy#hit_the_switch has boolean parameter 'switch' (BooleanParameter)\n  [2]:Dummy#hit_the_switch is controlled by argument switch (ControlParameter)\n\nNote that both smells are reported, Boolean Parameter and Control Parameter.\n\nGetting rid of the smell\n\nThis is highly dependent on your exact architecture, but looking at the example above what you could do is:\n\nMove everything in the if branch into a separate method\nMove everything in the else branch into a separate method\nGet rid of the hit_the_switch method altogether\nMake the decision what method to call in the initial caller of hit_the_switch\n\nCurrent support in Reek\n\nReek can only detect a Boolean Parameter when it has a default initializer like in the example above.",
