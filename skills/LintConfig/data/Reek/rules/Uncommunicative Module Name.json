        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn Uncommunicative Module Name is a module name that doesn't communicate its\nintent well enough. This code smell is a case of\nUncommunicative Name.\n\nCurrent Support in Reek\n\nUncommunicative Module Name checks for:\n\nsingle-character names\nany name ending with a number",
        "option": "Reek's Uncommunicative Module Name detector supports the Basic Smell Options, plus:\n\n| Option         | Value       | Effect  |\n| ---------------|-------------|---------|\n| reject | array of strings | The set of names that Reek uses to check for bad names. Defaults to single-letter names and names ending with a number. |\n| accept | array or strings | The set of names that Reek will accept (and not report) even if they match one of the reject expressions. Empty by default.|\n\nAn example configuration could look like this:\n\n```yaml\n\nUncommunicativeModuleName:\n  accept:\n    - lassy\n    - Util\n  reject:\n    - Helper\n```\n\nReek will convert whatever you give it as a string to the corresponding regex, so \"Helper\" from above will be converted to /Helper/ internally.\n\nApplying a configuration to a source file like this:\n\nruby\nclass Classy1; end # Should not be reported\nclass Util; end # Should not be reported\nclass BaseHelper; end # Should be reported\n\nReek would report:\n\nsmelly.rb -- 1 warning:\n  [3]:UncommunicativeModuleName: BaseHelper has the name 'BaseHelper'\n\nSometimes just strings are not enough for configuration. E.g. consider this code sample:\n\n```ruby\nclass Klassy\n  # ...\nend\n\nclass KlassyModule\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nand now imagine that you want to reject the name \"Klassy\" but not \"KlassyModule\". This wouldn't be possible with just using strings.\nFor this reason Reek has a special syntax that allows you to use regexes by using a forward slash at the beginning and the end of the string.\nEverything within the forward slashes will be loaded as a regex.\n\nA possible configuration that allows \"KlassyModule\" but rejects \"Klassy\" could look like this:\n\n```yaml\n\nUncommunicativeModuleName:\n  reject:\n    - \"/^Klassy$/\"\n```\n\nReek 4\n\nIn Reek 4 you could also pass regexes to accept or reject, meaning this was perfectly valid as well:\n\nyaml\nUncommunicativeModuleName:\n  accept:\n    - !ruby/regexp /foobar/\n\nSupport for this has been scrapped with Reek 5 to make the Reek configuration more yaml standard compliant.\nYou can still pass in regexes, you just have to wrap them into a string. Please see \"Advanced configuration\" above."
