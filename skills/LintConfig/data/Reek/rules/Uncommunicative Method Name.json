        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn Uncommunicative Method Name is a method name that doesn't communicate its\nintent well enough. This code smell is a case of\nUncommunicative Name.\n\nCurrent Support in Reek\n\nUncommunicative Method Name checks for:\n\nsingle-character names\nany name ending with a number\ncamelCaseMethodNames",
        "option": "Reek's Uncommunicative Method Name detector supports the\nBasic Smell Options, plus:\n\n| Option         | Value       | Effect  |\n| ---------------|-------------|---------|\n| reject | array of strings | The set of names that Reek uses to check for bad names. Defaults to single-letter names, names ending with a number or names containing upper case letters. |\n| accept | array of strings | The set of names that Reek will accept (and not report) even if they match one of the reject expressions. |\n\nAn example configuration could look like this:\n\n```yaml\n\nUncommunicativeMethodName:\n  accept:\n    - x\n    - meth1\n  reject:\n    - helper\n    - foobar\n```\n\nReek will convert whatever you give it as a string to the corresponding regex, so \"foobar\" from above will be converted to /foobar/ internally.\n\nApplying a configuration to a source file like this:\n\nruby\ndef x; end # Should not be reported\ndef meth1; end # Should not be reported\ndef foobar; end # Should be reported\ndef awesome_helper; end # Should be reported\n\nReek would report:\n\nsmelly.rb -- 2 warnings:\n  [4]:UncommunicativeMethodName: awesome_helper has the name 'awesome_helper'\n  [3]:UncommunicativeMethodName: foobar has the name 'foobar'\n\nSometimes just strings are not enough for configuration. E.g. consider this code sample:\n\nruby\nclass Klass\n  def foo; end\n  def foobar; end;\nend\n\nand now imagine that you want to reject the name \"foo\" but not \"foobar\". This wouldn't be possible with just using strings.\nFor this reason Reek has a special syntax that allows you to use regexes by using a forward slash at the beginning and the end of the string.\nEverything within the forward slashes will be loaded as a regex.\n\nA possible configuration that allows \"foobar\" but rejects \"foo\" could look like this:\n\n```yaml\n\nUncommunicativeMethodName:\n  reject:\n    - \"/^foo$/\"\n```\n\nReek 4\n\nIn Reek 4 you could also pass regexes to accept or reject, meaning this was perfectly valid as well:\n\nyaml\nUncommunicativeMethodName:\n  accept:\n    - !ruby/regexp /foobar/\n\nSupport for this has been scrapped with Reek 5 to make the Reek configuration more yaml standard compliant.\nYou can still pass in regexes, you just have to wrap them into a string. Please see \"Advanced configuration\" above."
