        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nRepeated Conditional is a case of\nSimulated Polymorphism. Basically it means you are\nchecking the same value throughout a single class and take decisions based on\nthis.\n\nExample\n\nGiven\n\n```ruby\nclass RepeatedConditionals\n  attr_accessor :switch\n\ndef repeat_1\n    puts \"Repeat 1!\" if switch\n  end\n\ndef repeat_2\n    puts \"Repeat 2!\" if switch\n  end\n\ndef repeat_3\n    puts \"Repeat 3!\" if switch\n  end\nend\n```\n\nReek would emit the following warning:\n\ntest.rb -- 4 warnings:\n  [5, 9, 13]:RepeatedConditionals tests switch at least 3 times (RepeatedConditional)\n\nIf you get this warning then you are probably not using the right abstraction or even more probable, missing an additional abstraction.",

Defaults to 2. |"
