        "description": "Description\n\nIntroduction\n\nA method with Too Many Statements is any method that has a large number of lines.\n\nCurrent Support in Reek\n\nToo Many Statements warns about any method that has more than 5 statements.\nReek's smell detector for Too Many Statements counts +1 for every simple\nstatement in a method and +1 for every statement within a control structure\n(if, else, case, when, for, while, until, begin, rescue) but\nit doesn't count the control structure itself.\n\nSo the following method would score +6 in Reek's statement-counting algorithm:\n\nruby\ndef parse(arg, argv, &error)\n  if !(val = arg) and (argv.empty? or /\\A-/ =~ (val = argv[0]))\n    return nil, block, nil                                         # +1\n  end\n  opt = (val = parse_arg(val, &error))[1]                          # +2\n  val = conv_arg(*val)                                             # +3\n  if opt and !arg\n    argv.shift                                                     # +4\n  else\n    val[0] = nil                                                   # +5\n  end\n  val                                                              # +6\nend\n\n(You might argue that the two assignments within the first @if@ should count as statements, and that perhaps the nested assignment should count as +2.)",
        "option": "Reek's Too Many Statements detector supports the Basic Smell Options, plus:\n\n| Option         | Value       | Effect  |\n| ---------------|-------------|---------|\n| max_statements |  integer | The maximum number of statements allowed in a method before a warning is issued. Defaults to 5. |\n\nToo Many Statements's default configuration is:\n\n```yaml\n\nTooManyStatements:\n  enabled: true\n  exclude:\n  - initialize\n  max_statements: 5\n```\n\nBy default, initialize is not checked for length; any class's constructor can be as long as necessary."
