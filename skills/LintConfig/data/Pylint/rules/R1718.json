Also it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list Problematic code: NUMBERS = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] # +1: [consider-using-set-comprehension] UNIQUE_EVEN_NUMBERS = set([number for number in NUMBERS if number % 2 == 0]) Correct code: NUMBERS = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4] UNIQUE_EVEN_NUMBERS = {number for number in NUMBERS if number % 2 == 0} Additional details: pyupgrade or ruff can fix this issue automatically.
