  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: consider-alternative-union-syntax] [Message: Consider using alternative union syntax instead of '%s'%s] Description: Emitted when ``typing.Union`` or ``typing.Optional`` is used instead of the shorthand union syntax. For example, ``Union[int, float]`` instead of ``int | float``. Using the shorthand for unions aligns with Python typing recommendations, removes the need for imports, and avoids confusion in function signatures. Problematic code: from typing import Optional, Union def forecast( temp: Union[int, float], # [consider-alternative-union-syntax] unit: Optional[str], # [consider-alternative-union-syntax] ) -> None: print(f'Temperature: {temp}{unit or \"\"}') Correct code: def forecast(temp: int | float, unit: str | None) -> None: print(f'Temperature: {temp}{unit or \"\"}') Configuration file: [MAIN] load-plugins = pylint.extensions.typing Additional details: Using the shorthand syntax for union types is recommended over the typing module. This is consistent with the broader recommendation to prefer built-in types over imports (for example, using list instead of the now-deprecated typing.List). typing.Optional can also cause confusion in annotated function arguments, since an argument annotated as Optional is still a required argument when a default value is not set. Explicitly annotating such arguments with type | None makes the intention clear. Note This message is emitted by the optional 'typing' checker, which requires the pylint.extensions.typing plugin to be loaded. Created by the typing checker.",
