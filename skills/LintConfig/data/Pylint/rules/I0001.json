  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: raw-checker-failed] [Message: Unable to run raw checkers on built-in module %s] Description: Used to inform that a built-in module has not been checked using the raw checkers. Caution This message is disabled by default. To enable it, add raw-checker-failed to the enable option. Caution By default, this message will not fail the execution (pylint will return 0). To make pylint fail for this message use the --fail-on=I0001 option or --fail-on=I to fail on all enabled informational messages. Additional details: This warns you that a builtin module was impossible to analyse (an ast node is not pure python). There's nothing to change in your code, this is a warning about astroid and pylint's limitations. Created by the main checker.",
