  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: logging-not-lazy] [Message: Use %s formatting in logging functions] Description: Used when a logging statement has a call form of \"logging.<logging method>(format_string % (format_args...))\". Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-format-interpolation is disabled then you can use str.format. Problematic code: import logging try: function() except Exception as e: logging.error(\"Error occurred: %s\" % e) # [logging-not-lazy] raise Correct code: import logging try: function() except Exception as e: logging.error(\"Error occurred: %s\", e) raise Additional details: Another reasonable option is to use f-strings. If you want to do that, you need to enable logging-not-lazy and disable logging-fstring-interpolation.
