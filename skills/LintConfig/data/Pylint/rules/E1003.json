  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: bad-super-call] [Message: Bad first argument %r given to super()] Description: Used when another argument than the current class is given as first argument of the super builtin. Problematic code: class Animal: pass class Tree: pass class Cat(Animal): def __init__(self): super(Tree, self).__init__() # [bad-super-call] super(Animal, self).__init__() Correct code: class Animal: pass class Tree: pass class Cat(Animal): def __init__(self): super(Animal, self).__init__() Additional details: In Python 2.7, super() has to be called with its own class and self as arguments (super(Cat, self)), which can lead to a mix up of parent and child class in the code. In Python 3 the recommended way is to call super() without arguments (see also super-with-arguments). One exception is calling super() on a non-direct parent class. This can be used to get a method other than the default method returned by the mro(). Related links: Documentation for super() Created by the newstyle checker.",
