  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: use-implicit-booleaness-not-len] [Message: Do not use `len(SEQUENCE)` without comparison to determine if a sequence is empty] Description: Empty sequences are considered false in a boolean context. You can either remove the call to 'len' (``if not x``) or compare the length against a scalar (``if len(x) > 1``). Problematic code: fruits = [\"orange\", \"apple\"] if len(fruits): # [use-implicit-booleaness-not-len] print(fruits) Correct code: fruits = [\"orange\", \"apple\"] if fruits: print(fruits) Created by the refactoring checker.",
