  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: use-maxsplit-arg] [Message: Use %s instead] Description: Emitted when accessing only the first or last element of str.split(). The first and last element can be accessed by using str.split(sep, maxsplit=1)[0] or str.rsplit(sep, maxsplit=1)[-1] instead. Problematic code: url = \"www.example.com\" suffix = url.split(\".\")[-1] # [use-maxsplit-arg] Correct code: url = \"www.example.com\" suffix = url.rsplit(\".\", maxsplit=1)[-1] Additional details: Be aware that the performance improvement from not splitting the string so many times will only be realized in cases presenting more instances of the splitting character than the minimal example here.
