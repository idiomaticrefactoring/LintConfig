  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: invalid-sequence-index] [Message: Sequence index is not an int, slice, or instance with __index__] Description: Used when a sequence type is indexed with an invalid type. Valid types are ints, slices, and objects with an __index__ method. Problematic code: fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"] print(fruits[\"apple\"]) # [invalid-sequence-index] Correct code: fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"] print(fruits[0]) Additional details: Be careful with [True] or [False] as sequence index, since True and False will respectively be evaluated as 1 and 0 and will bring the second element of the list and the first without erroring.
