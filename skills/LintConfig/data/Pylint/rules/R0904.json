  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: too-many-public-methods] [Message: Too many public methods (%s/%s)] Description: Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a simpler (and so easier to use) class. Problematic code: class SpaceInvaders: # [too-many-public-methods] def __init__(self): pass def fire_laser_beam(self): pass def deploy_shield(self): pass def launch_missile(self): pass def activate_super_laser(self): pass def summon_mothership(self): pass def destroy_planet(self): pass def teleport(self): pass def invoke_aliens(self): pass def invade_earth(self): pass def takeover_galaxy(self): pass Correct code: class LaserBeam: def __init__(self): pass def fire(self): pass def activate_super(self): pass def destroy_planet(self): pass class Shield: def deploy(self): pass class Missile: def launch(self): pass class SpaceInvaders: def __init__(self): self.laser = LaserBeam() self.shield = Shield() self.missile = Missile() def summon_mothership(self): pass def destroy_planet(self): pass def teleport(self): pass def invoke_aliens(self): pass def invade_earth(self): pass def takeover_galaxy(self): pass Configuration file: [main] max-public-methods=7 Additional details: Having too many public methods is an indication that you might not be respecting the Single-responsibility principle (S of SOLID). The class should have only one reason to change, but in the example the spaceship has at least 4 persons that could ask for change to it (laser manager, shield manager, missile manager, teleportation officer...).
