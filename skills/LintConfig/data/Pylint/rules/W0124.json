  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: confusing-with-statement] [Message: Following \"as\" with another context manager looks like a tuple.] Description: Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context manager. Problematic code: with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as fh1, fh2: # [confusing-with-statement] pass Correct code: with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf8\") as fh1: with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\", encoding=\"utf8\") as fh2: pass Created by the basic checker.",
