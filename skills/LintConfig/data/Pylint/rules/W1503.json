  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redundant-unittest-assert] [Message: Redundant use of %s with constant value %r] Description: The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this case a warning should be emitted. Problematic code: import unittest class DummyTestCase(unittest.TestCase): def test_dummy(self): self.assertTrue(\"foo\") # [redundant-unittest-assert] Correct code: import unittest class DummyTestCase(unittest.TestCase): def test_dummy(self): actual = \"test_result\" self.assertEqual(actual, \"expected\") Additional details: Directly asserting a string literal will always pass. The solution is to test something that could fail, or not assert at all. For assertions using assert there are similar messages: assert-on-string-literal / W0129 and assert-on-tuple / W0199.
