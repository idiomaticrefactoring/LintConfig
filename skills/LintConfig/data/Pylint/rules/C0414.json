  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: useless-import-alias] [Message: Import alias does not rename original package] Description: Used when an import alias is same as original package, e.g., using import numpy as numpy instead of import numpy as np. Problematic code: import pandas as pandas # [useless-import-alias] Correct code: import pandas as pd Additional details: Known issue¶ If you prefer to use \"from-as\" to explicitly reexport in API (from fruit import orange as orange) instead of using __all__ this message will be a false positive. Use --allow-reexport-from-package to allow explicit reexports by alias in package __init__ files.
