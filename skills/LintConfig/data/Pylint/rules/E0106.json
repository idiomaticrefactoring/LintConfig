  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: return-arg-in-generator] [Message: Return with argument inside generator] Description: Used when a \"return\" statement with an argument is found in a generator function or method (e.g. with some \"yield\" statements). Correct code: def yield_numbers(): for number in range(10): yield number return \"I am now allowed!\" # This was not allowed in Python 3.3 and earlier. Additional details: This is a message that isn't going to be raised for python > 3.3. It was raised for code like: def interrogate_until_you_find_jack(pirates): for pirate in pirates: if pirate == \"Captain Jack Sparrow\": return \"Arrr! We've found our captain!\" yield pirate Which is now valid and equivalent to the previously expected: def interrogate_until_you_find_jack(pirates): for pirate in pirates: if pirate == \"Captain Jack Sparrow\": raise StopIteration(\"Arrr! We've found our captain!\") yield pirate Related links: PEP380 Stackoverflow explanation Created by the basic checker.",
