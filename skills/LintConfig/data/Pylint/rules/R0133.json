  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: comparison-of-constants] [Message: Comparison between constants: \"%s %s %s\" has a constant value] Description: When two literals are compared with each other the result is a constant. Using the constant directly is both easier to read and more performant. Initializing 'True' and 'False' this way is not required since Python 2.3. Problematic code: def is_the_answer() -> bool: return 42 == 42 # [comparison-of-constants] Correct code: def is_the_answer(meaning_of_life: int) -> bool: return meaning_of_life == 42 Created by the basic checker.",
