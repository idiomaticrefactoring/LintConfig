Instead, an existing instance should be used to acquire lock. Problematic code: import threading with threading.Lock(): # [useless-with-lock] print(\"Make your bed.\") with threading.Lock(): # [useless-with-lock] print(\"Sleep in it\") Correct code: import threading lock = threading.Lock() with lock: print(\"Make your bed.\") with lock: print(\"Sleep in it.\") Created by the threading checker.",
