  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: misplaced-bare-raise] [Message: The raise statement is not inside an except clause] Description: Used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause. This generates an error, since there are no active exceptions to be reraised. An exception to this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a finally clause, which might work, as long as an exception is raised inside the try block, but it is nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon. Problematic code: def validate_positive(x): if x <= 0: raise # [misplaced-bare-raise] Correct code: def validate_positive(x): if x <= 0: raise ValueError(f\"{x} is not positive\") Created by the exceptions checker.",
