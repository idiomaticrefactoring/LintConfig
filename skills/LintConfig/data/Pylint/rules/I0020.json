  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: suppressed-message] [Message: Suppressed %s (from line %d)] Description: A message was triggered on a line, but suppressed explicitly by a disable= comment in the file. This message is not generated for messages that are ignored due to configuration settings. Caution This message is disabled by default. To enable it, add suppressed-message to the enable option. Caution By default, this message will not fail the execution (pylint will return 0). To make pylint fail for this message use the --fail-on=I0020 option or --fail-on=I to fail on all enabled informational messages. Problematic code: ### This is a contrived example, to show how suppressed-message works. ### First we enable all messages # pylint: enable=all ### Here we disable two messages so we get two warnings # pylint: disable=locally-disabled, useless-suppression # [suppressed-message, suppressed-message] ### Here we disable a message, so we get a warning for suppressed-message again. \"A\" # pylint: disable=pointless-statement # [suppressed-message, suppressed-message] Correct code: \"\"\"Instead of a single string somewhere in the file, write a module docstring!\"\"\" Additional details: suppressed-message is simply a way to see messages that would be raised without the disable in your codebase. It should not be activated most of the time. See also useless-suppression if you want to see the message that are disabled for no reasons. Created by the main checker.",
