Problematic code: from logging import getLogger from pathlib import Path # [unused-import] LOGGER = getLogger(__name__) Correct code: from logging import getLogger LOGGER = getLogger(__name__) Additional details: By default, this check is skipped for __init__.py files, as they often contain imports from submodules for the convenience of end users. While these imports are not used within __init__.py, they serve the purpose of providing intuitive import paths for the module's important classes and constants.
