Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension. Also it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list Problematic code: NUMBERS = [1, 2, 3] # +1: [consider-using-dict-comprehension] DOUBLED_NUMBERS = dict([(number, number * 2) for number in NUMBERS]) Correct code: NUMBERS = [1, 2, 3] DOUBLED_NUMBERS = {number: number * 2 for number in NUMBERS} Additional details: pyupgrade or ruff can fix this issue automatically.
