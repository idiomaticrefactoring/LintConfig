Doing so can result in unexpected behaviour, that is why it is preferred to use a copy of the list. Problematic code: fruits = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\"] for fruit in fruits: fruits.append(\"pineapple\") # [modified-iterating-list] Correct code: fruits = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"mango\"] for fruit in fruits.copy(): fruits.append(\"pineapple\") Created by the modified_iteration checker.",
