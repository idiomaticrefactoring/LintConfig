  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: implicit-str-concat] [Message: Implicit string concatenation found in %s] Description: String literals are implicitly concatenated in a literal iterable definition : maybe a comma is missing ? Problematic code: list.py: x = [\"a\" \"b\"] # [implicit-str-concat] open.py: with open(\"hello.txt\" \"r\") as f: # [implicit-str-concat] print(f.read()) Correct code: list.py: x = [\"a\", \"b\"] open.py: with open(\"hello.txt\", \"r\") as f: print(f.read()) Additional details: By default, detection of implicit string concatenation of line jumps is disabled. Hence the following code will not trigger this rule: SEQ = ('a', 'b' 'c') In order to detect this case, you must enable check-str-concat-over-line-jumps: [STRING_CONSTANT] check-str-concat-over-line-jumps = true However, the drawback of this setting is that it will trigger false positive for string parameters passed on multiple lines in function calls: warnings.warn( \"rotate() is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. \" \"Use the rotation() context manager instead.\", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=3, ) No message will be emitted, though, if you clarify the wanted concatenation with parentheses: warnings.warn( ( \"rotate() is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. \" \"Use the rotation() context manager instead.\" ), DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=3, ) Created by the string checker.",
