  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: consider-using-generator] [Message: Consider using a generator instead '%s(%s)'] Description: If your container can be large using a generator will bring better performance. Problematic code: list([0 for y in list(range(10))]) # [consider-using-generator] tuple([0 for y in list(range(10))]) # [consider-using-generator] sum([y**2 for y in list(range(10))]) # [consider-using-generator] max([y**2 for y in list(range(10))]) # [consider-using-generator] min([y**2 for y in list(range(10))]) # [consider-using-generator] Correct code: list(0 for y in list(range(10))) tuple(0 for y in list(range(10))) sum(y**2 for y in list(range(10))) max(y**2 for y in list(range(10))) min(y**2 for y in list(range(10))) Additional details: Removing [] inside calls that can use containers or generators should be considered for performance reasons since a generator will have an upfront cost to pay. The performance will be better if you are working with long lists or sets. For max, min and sum using a generator is also recommended by pep289.
