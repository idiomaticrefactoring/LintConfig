Problematic code: parrot.py: shop = { # animal: (specie, descriptions) \"parrot\": (\"Norvegian blue\", (\"restin'\", \"remarkable\", \"beautiful plumage\")), } if \"parrot\" in shop is \"restin'\": # [bad-chained-comparison] print(\"Hellooooo, Pooolllllyyy ! WAAAAKEEY, WAKKEEEY !\") xor.py: def xor_check(*, left=None, right=None): if left is None != right is None: # [bad-chained-comparison] raise ValueError( \"Either both left= and right= need to be provided or none should.\" ) Correct code: parrot.py: shop = { # animal: (specie, descriptions) \"parrot\": (\"Norvegian blue\", (\"restin'\", \"remarkable\", \"beautiful plumage\")), } if \"parrot\" in shop and \"restin'\" in shop[\"parrot\"][1]: print(\"Hellooooo, Pooolllllyyy ! WAAAAKEEY, WAKKEEEY !\") xor.py: def xor_check(*, left=None, right=None): if (left is None) != (right is None): raise ValueError( \"Either both left= and right= need to be provided or none should.\" ) Related links: Comparison Chaining Created by the bad-chained-comparison checker.",
