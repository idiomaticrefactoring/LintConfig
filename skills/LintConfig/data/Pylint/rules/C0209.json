  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: consider-using-f-string] [Message: Formatting a regular string which could be an f-string] Description: Used when we detect a string that is being formatted with format() or % which could potentially be an f-string. The use of f-strings is preferred. Requires Python 3.6 and ``py-version >= 3.6``. Problematic code: from string import Template menu = (\"eggs\", \"spam\", 42.4) old_order = \"%s and %s: %.2f ¤\" % menu # [consider-using-f-string] beginner_order = menu[0] + \" and \" + menu[1] + \": \" + str(menu[2]) + \" ¤\" joined_order = \" and \".join(menu[:2]) # +1: [consider-using-f-string] format_order = \"{} and {}: {:0.2f} ¤\".format(menu[0], menu[1], menu[2]) # +1: [consider-using-f-string] named_format_order = \"{eggs} and {spam}: {price:0.2f} ¤\".format( eggs=menu[0], spam=menu[1], price=menu[2] ) template_order = Template(\"$eggs and $spam: $price ¤\").substitute( eggs=menu[0], spam=menu[1], price=menu[2] ) Correct code: menu = (\"eggs\", \"spam\", 42.4) f_string_order = f\"{menu[0]} and {menu[1]}: {menu[2]:0.2f} ¤\" Additional details: Formatted string literals (f-strings) give a concise, consistent syntax that can replace most use cases for the % formatting operator, str.format() and string.Template. F-strings also perform better than alternatives; see this tweet for a simple example. Created by the refactoring checker.",
