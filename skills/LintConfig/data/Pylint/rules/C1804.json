  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string] [Message: \"%s\" can be simplified to \"%s\", if it is strictly a string, as an empty string is falsey] Description: Empty string are considered false in a boolean context. Following this check blindly in weakly typed code base can create hard to debug issues. If the value can be something else that is falsey but not a string (for example ``None``, an empty sequence, or ``0``) the code will not be equivalent. Caution This message is disabled by default. To enable it, add use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string to the enable option. Problematic code: def important_string_manipulation(x: str, y: str) -> None: if x == \"\": # [use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string] print(\"x is an empty string\") if y != \"\": # [use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string] print(\"y is not an empty string\") Correct code: def important_string_manipulation(x: str, y: str) -> None: if not x: print(\"x is an empty string\") if y: print(\"y is not an empty string\") Configuration file: [main] enable=use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string Created by the refactoring checker.",
