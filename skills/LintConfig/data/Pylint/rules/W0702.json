  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: bare-except] [Message: No exception type(s) specified] Description: A bare ``except:`` clause will catch ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with ``Control-C``, and can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use ``except Exception:`` (bare except is equivalent to ``except BaseException:``). Problematic code: try: import platform_specific_module except: # [bare-except] platform_specific_module = None Correct code: try: import platform_specific_module except ImportError: platform_specific_module = None Additional details: A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare ‘except’ clauses to two cases: - If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has occurred. - If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the exception propagate upwards with raise. try...finally can be a better way to handle this case.
