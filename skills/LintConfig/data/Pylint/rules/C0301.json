  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: line-too-long] [Message: Line too long (%s/%s)] Description: Used when a line is longer than a given number of characters. Problematic code: # +1: [line-too-long] FRUIT = [\"apricot\", \"blackcurrant\", \"cantaloupe\", \"dragon fruit\", \"elderberry\", \"fig\", \"grapefruit\", ] Correct code: FRUIT = [ \"apricot\", \"blackcurrant\", \"cantaloupe\", \"dragon fruit\", \"elderberry\", \"fig\", \"grapefruit\", ] Configuration file: [MAIN] max-line-length=100 Additional details: Pragma controls such as # pylint: disable=all are not counted toward line length for the purposes of this message. If you attempt to disable this message via # pylint: disable=line-too-long in a module with no code, you may receive a message for useless-suppression. This is a false positive of useless-suppression we can't easily fix. See https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3368 for more information. Created by the format checker.",
