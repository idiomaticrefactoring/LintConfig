Problematic code: not_enough_fruits = [\"apple\"] print('The second fruit is a {fruits[1]}'.format(fruits=not_enough_fruits)) # [invalid-format-index] Correct code: enough_fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"] print(\"The second fruit is a {fruits[1]}\".format(fruits=enough_fruits)) Created by the string checker.",
