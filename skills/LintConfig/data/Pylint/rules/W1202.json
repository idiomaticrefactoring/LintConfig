  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: logging-format-interpolation] [Message: Use %s formatting in logging functions] Description: Used when a logging statement has a call form of \"logging.<logging method>(format_string.format(format_args...))\". Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-not-lazy is disabled then you can use % formatting as normal. Problematic code: import logging import sys # +1: [logging-format-interpolation] logging.error(\"Python version: {}\".format(sys.version)) Correct code: import logging import sys logging.error(\"Python version: %s\", sys.version) Additional details: Another reasonable option is to use f-string. If you want to do that, you need to enable logging-format-interpolation and disable logging-fstring-interpolation.
