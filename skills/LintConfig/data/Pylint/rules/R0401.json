Problematic code: __init__.py: bad.py: def count_to_one(): return 1 def count_to_three(): from .bad2 import count_to_two return count_to_two() + 1 bad2.py: from .bad import count_to_one # [cyclic-import] def count_to_two(): return count_to_one() + 1 Correct code: def count_to_one(): return 1 def count_to_two(): return count_to_one() + 1 def count_to_three(): return count_to_two() + 1 Additional details: The good code is just an example.
