Use a set instead if elements are hashable.] Description: To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, combine the values into a set or tuple and check if the variable is contained \"in\" it instead of checking for equality against each of the values. This is faster and less verbose. Problematic code: def fruit_is_round(fruit): # +1: [consider-using-in] return fruit == \"apple\" or fruit == \"orange\" or fruit == \"melon\" Correct code: def fruit_is_round(fruit): return fruit in {\"apple\", \"orange\", \"melon\"} Created by the refactoring checker.",
