Problematic code: def fruits_to_string(fruits): formatted_fruit = \"\" for fruit in fruits: formatted_fruit += fruit # [consider-using-join] return formatted_fruit print(fruits_to_string([\"apple\", \"pear\", \"peach\"])) Correct code: print(\"\".join([\"apple\", \"pear\", \"peach\"])) Created by the refactoring checker.",
