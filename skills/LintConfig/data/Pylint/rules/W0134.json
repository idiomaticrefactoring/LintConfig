This will overwrite the return value of a function and should be avoided. Problematic code: def second_favorite(): fruits = [\"kiwi\", \"pineapple\"] try: return fruits[1] finally: # because of this `return` statement, this function will always return \"kiwi\" return fruits[0] # [return-in-finally] Correct code: def second_favorite(): fruits = [\"kiwi\", \"pineapple\"] try: return fruits[1] except KeyError: ... return fruits[0] Related links: Python 3 docs 'finally' clause PEP 765 - Disallow return/break/continue that exit a finally block Created by the basic checker.",
