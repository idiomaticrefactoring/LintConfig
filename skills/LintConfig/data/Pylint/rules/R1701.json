Problematic code: from typing import Any def is_number(value: Any) -> bool: # +1: [consider-merging-isinstance] return isinstance(value, int) or isinstance(value, float) Correct code: from typing import Any def is_number(value: Any) -> bool: return isinstance(value, (int, float)) Created by the refactoring checker.",
