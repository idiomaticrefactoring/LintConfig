Problematic code: double_not.py: if not not input(): # [unnecessary-negation] pass equivalent_comparator_exists.py: a = 3 b = 10 if not a > b: # [unnecessary-negation] pass Correct code: double_not.py: if input(): pass equivalent_comparator_exists.py: a = 3 b = 10 if a <= b: pass Created by the refactoring checker.",
