Problematic code: import random # +1: [using-assignment-expression-in-unsupported-version] if zero_or_one := random.randint(0, 1): assert zero_or_one == 1 Correct code: import random zero_or_one = random.randint(0, 1) if zero_or_one: assert zero_or_one == 1 Configuration file: [main] py-version=3.7 Additional details: The assignment expression (walrus) operator (:=) was introduced in Python 3.8; to use it, please use a more recent version of Python.
