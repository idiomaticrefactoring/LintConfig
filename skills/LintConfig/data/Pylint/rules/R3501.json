  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: consider-refactoring-into-while-condition] [Message: Consider using 'while %s' instead of 'while %s:' an 'if', and a 'break'] Description: Emitted when `while True:` loop is used and the first statement is a break condition. The ``if / break`` construct can be removed if the check is inverted and moved to the ``while`` statement. Problematic code: fruit_basket = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"guava\"] while True: # [consider-refactoring-into-while-condition] if len(fruit_basket) == 0: break fruit = fruit_basket.pop() print(f\"We removed {fruit} from the basket\") Correct code: fruit_basket = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"guava\"] while len(fruit_basket) != 0: fruit = fruit_basket.pop() print(f\"We removed {fruit} from the basket\") Configuration file: [MAIN] load-plugins=pylint.extensions.consider_refactoring_into_while_condition Note This message is emitted by the optional 'consider_refactoring_into_while' checker, which requires the pylint.extensions.consider_refactoring_into_while_condition plugin to be loaded. Created by the consider_refactoring_into_while checker.",
