  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redefined-outer-name] [Message: Redefining name %r from outer scope (line %s)] Description: Used when a variable's name hides a name defined in an outer scope or except handler. Problematic code: count = 10 def count_it(count): # [redefined-outer-name] for i in range(count): print(i) Correct code: count = 10 def count_it(limit): for i in range(limit): print(i) Additional details: A common issue is that this message is triggered when using pytest fixtures: import pytest @pytest.fixture def setup(): ... def test_something(setup): # [redefined-outer-name] ... One solution to this problem is to explicitly name the fixture: @pytest.fixture(name=\"setup\") def setup_fixture(): ... Alternatively pylint plugins like pylint-pytest can be used.
