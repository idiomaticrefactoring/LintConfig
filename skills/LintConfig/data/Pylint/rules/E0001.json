Problematic code: fruit_stock = { 'apple': 42, 'orange': 21 # [syntax-error] 'banana': 12 } Correct code: fruit_stock = {\"apple\": 42, \"orange\": 21, \"banana\": 12} Additional details: The python's ast builtin module cannot parse your code if there's a syntax error, so if there's a syntax error other messages won't be available at all.
