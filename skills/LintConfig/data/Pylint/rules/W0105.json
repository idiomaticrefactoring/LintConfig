This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of comments. Problematic code: \"\"\"This is a docstring which describes the module\"\"\" \"\"\"This is not a docstring\"\"\" # [pointless-string-statement] Correct code: \"\"\"This is a docstring which describes the module\"\"\" # This is comment which describes a particular part of the module.
