Problematic code: class Book: __match_args__ = (\"title\", \"year\") def __init__(self, title, year): self.title = title self.year = year def func(item: Book): match item: case Book(title=str(title)): # [match-class-bind-self] ... case Book(year=int(year)): # [match-class-bind-self] ... Correct code: class Book: __match_args__ = (\"title\", \"year\") def __init__(self, title, year): self.title = title self.year = year def func(item: Book): match item: case Book(title=str() as title): ... case Book(year=int() as year): ...
