  "description": "[Status: stable] [Name: redefined-builtin] [Message: Redefining built-in %r] Description: Used when a variable or function override a built-in. Problematic code: def map(): # [redefined-builtin] pass Correct code: def map_iterable(): pass Additional details: The allowed-redefined-builtins option lets you specify names that are permitted to shadow built-ins. However, this option is not effective for redefinitions at the module level or for global variables. For example: Module-Level Redefinitions: # module_level_redefine.py id = 1 # Shadows the built-in `id` Global Variable Redefinitions: # global_variable_redefine.py def my_func(): global len len = 1 # Shadows the built-in `len` Rationale: Shadowing built-ins at the global scope is discouraged because it obscures their behavior throughout the entire module, increasing the risk of subtle bugs when the built-in is needed elsewhere. In contrast, local redefinitions are acceptable as their impact is confined to a specific scope, reducing unintended side effects and simplifying debugging. Created by the variables checker.",
