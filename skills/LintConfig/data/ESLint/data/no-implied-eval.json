There are security and performance implications involved with doing so, which is why many linters (including ESLint) recommend disallowingeval(). However, there are some other ways to pass a string and have it interpreted as JavaScript code that have similar concerns.\nThe first is usingsetTimeout(),setInterval()orexecScript()(Internet Explorer only), all of which can accept a string of JavaScript code as their first argument. For example:\nsetTimeout(\"alert('Hi!');\",100);1Copy code to clipboard\nThis is considered an impliedeval()because a string of JavaScript code is\npassed in to be interpreted. The same can be done withsetInterval()andexecScript(). Both interpret the JavaScript code in  the global scope. For  bothsetTimeout()andsetInterval(), the first argument can also be a function, and that is considered safer and is more performant:\nsetTimeout(function(){alert(\"Hi!\");},100);123Copy code to clipboard\nThe best practice is to always use a function for the first argument ofsetTimeout()andsetInterval()(and avoidexecScript()).",
