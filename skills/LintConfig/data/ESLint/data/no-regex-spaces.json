One of the more error-prone things you can do with a regular expression is to use more than one space, such as:\nconstre=/foo   bar/;1Copy code to clipboard\nIn this regular expression, it’s very hard to tell how many spaces are intended to be matched. It’s better to use only one space and then specify how many spaces are expected, such as:\nconstre=/foo {3}bar/;1Copy code to clipboard\nNow it is very clear that three spaces are expected to be matched.",
