There are many styles and preferences related to the declaration of variables, and one of those is deciding on how many variable declarations should be allowed in a single function.\nThere are two schools of thought in this regard:\nThere should be just one variable declaration for all variables in the function. That declaration typically appears at the top of the function.You should use one variable declaration for each variable you want to define.\nFor instance:\n// one variable declaration per functionfunctionfoo(){varbar,baz;}// multiple variable declarations per functionfunctionfoo(){varbar;varbaz;}12345678910Copy code to clipboard\nThe single-declaration school of thought is based in pre-ECMAScript 6 behaviors, where there was no such thing as block scope, only function scope. Since allvarstatements are hoisted to the top of the function anyway, some believe that declaring all variables in a single declaration at the top of the function removes confusion around scoping rules.",
