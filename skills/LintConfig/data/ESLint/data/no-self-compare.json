It is confusing to the reader and may potentially introduce a runtime error.\nThe only time you would compare a variable against itself is when you are testing forNaN. However, it is far more appropriate to usetypeof x === 'number' && isNaN(x)or theNumber.isNaN ES2015 functionfor that use case rather than leaving the reader of the code to determine the intent of self comparison.",
