You can require or disallow semicolons with thesemirule.\nThe rules for ASI are relatively straightforward: As once described by Isaac Schlueter, a newline character always ends a statement, just like a semicolon,exceptwhere one of the following is true:\nThe statement has an unclosed paren, array literal, or object literal or ends in some other way that is not a valid way to end a statement. (For instance, ending with.or,.)The line is--or++(in which case it will decrement/increment the next token.)It is afor(),while(),do,if(), orelse, and there is no{The next line starts with[,(,+,*,/,-,,,., or some other binary operator that can only be found between two tokens in a single expression.\nIn the exceptions where a newline doesnotend a statement, a typing mistake to omit a semicolon causes two unrelated consecutive lines to be interpreted as one expression. Especially for a coding style without semicolons, readers might overlook the mistake. Although syntactically correct, the code might throw exceptions when it is executed.",
