Unless there are side effects in the expressions, a duplicate will evaluate to the sametrueorfalsevalue as the identical expression earlier in the chain, meaning that its branch can never execute.\nif(a){foo();}elseif(b){bar();}elseif(b){baz();}1234567Copy code to clipboard\nIn the above example,baz()can never execute. Obviously,baz()could be executed only whenbevaluates totrue, but in that casebar()would be executed instead, since it’s earlier in the chain.",
