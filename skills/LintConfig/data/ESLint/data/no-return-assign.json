    "introduction": "Disallow assignment operators inreturnstatements\nTable of ContentsRule DetailsOptionsexcept-parensalwaysWhen Not To Use ItVersionResources\nOne of the interesting, and sometimes confusing, aspects of JavaScript is that assignment can happen at almost any point. Because of this, an errant equals sign can end up causing assignment when the true intent was to do a comparison. This is especially true when using areturnstatement. For example:\nfunctiondoSomething(){returnfoo=bar+2;}123Copy code to clipboard\nIt is difficult to tell the intent of thereturnstatement here. It’s possible that the function is meant to return the result ofbar + 2, but then why is it assigning tofoo? It’s also possible that the intent was to use a comparison operator such as==and that this code is an error.\nBecause of this ambiguity, it’s considered a best practice to not use assignment inreturnstatements.",
