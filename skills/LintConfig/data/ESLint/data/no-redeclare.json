This can lead to confusion as to where the variable is actually declared and initialized.",
    "sub_configuration_introduction": "This rule takes one optional argument, an object with a boolean property\"builtinGlobals\". It defaults totrue.\nIf set totrue, this rule also checks redeclaration of built-in globals, such asObject,Array,Number…\nThe\"builtinGlobals\"option will check for redeclaration of built-in globals in global scope.\nExamples ofincorrectcode for the{ \"builtinGlobals\": true }option:\nNote that when usingsourceType: \"commonjs\"(orecmaFeatures.globalReturn, if using the default parser), the top scope of a program is not actually the global scope, but rather a “module” scope. When this is the case, declaring a variable named after a builtin global is not a redeclaration, but rather a shadowing of the global variable. In that case, theno-shadowrule with the\"builtinGlobals\"option should be used.",
