This can lead to errors when it is assumed that objects will have properties fromObject.prototype. This rule prevents calling someObject.prototypemethods directly from an object.\nAdditionally, objects can have properties that shadow the builtins onObject.prototype, potentially causing unintended behavior or denial-of-service security vulnerabilities. For example, it would be unsafe for a webserver to parse JSON input from a client and callhasOwnPropertydirectly on the resulting object, because a malicious client could send a JSON value like{\"hasOwnProperty\": 1}and cause the server to crash.\nTo avoid subtle bugs like this, it’s better to always call these methods fromObject.prototype. For example,foo.hasOwnProperty(\"bar\")should be replaced withObject.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(foo, \"bar\").",
