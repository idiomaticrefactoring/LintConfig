        "description": "Description\n\nThis rule aims to enforce a consistent style of comments across your codebase, specifically by either requiring or disallowing a capitalized letter as the first word character in a comment. This rule will not issue warnings when non-cased letters are used.\n\nBy default, this rule will require a non-lowercase letter at the beginning of comments.\n\nExamples ofincorrectcode for this rule:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\"] */\n\n// lowercase comment\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode for this rule:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: error */\n\n// Capitalized comment\n\n// 1. Non-letter at beginning of comment\n\n// 丈 Non-Latin character at beginning of comment\n\n/* istanbul ignore next */\n/* jscs:enable */\n/* jshint asi:true */\n/* global foo */\n/* globals foo */\n/* exported myVar */\n// https://github.com\n\n/* eslint semi:2 */\n/* eslint-disable */\nfoo\n/* eslint-enable */\n// eslint-disable-next-line\nbaz\nbar // eslint-disable-line",
        "option": "This rule has two options: a string value\"always\"or\"never\"which determines whether capitalization of the first word of a comment should be required or forbidden, and optionally an object containing more configuration parameters for the rule.\n\nHere are the supported object options:\n\n- ignorePattern: A string representing a regular expression pattern of words that should be ignored by this rule. If the first word of a comment matches the pattern, this rule will not report that comment.Note that the following words are always ignored by this rule:[\"jscs\", \"jshint\", \"eslint\", \"istanbul\", \"global\", \"globals\", \"exported\"].\n- Note that the following words are always ignored by this rule:[\"jscs\", \"jshint\", \"eslint\", \"istanbul\", \"global\", \"globals\", \"exported\"].\n- ignoreInlineComments: If this istrue, the rule will not report on comments in the middle of code. By default, this isfalse.\n- ignoreConsecutiveComments: If this istrue, the rule will not report on a comment which violates the rule, as long as the comment immediately follows another comment. By default, this isfalse.\n\nHere is an example configuration:\n\n{\n    \"capitalized-comments\": [\n        \"error\",\n        \"always\",\n        {\n            \"ignorePattern\": \"pragma|ignored\",\n            \"ignoreInlineComments\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\"always\"\n\nUsing the\"always\"option means that this rule will report any comments which start with a lowercase letter. This is the default configuration for this rule.\n\nNote that configuration comments and comments which start with URLs are never reported.\n\nExamples ofincorrectcode for this rule:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\"] */\n\n// lowercase comment\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode for this rule:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\"] */\n\n// Capitalized comment\n\n// 1. Non-letter at beginning of comment\n\n// 丈 Non-Latin character at beginning of comment\n\n/* istanbul ignore next */\n/* jscs:enable */\n/* jshint asi:true */\n/* global foo */\n/* globals foo */\n/* exported myVar */\n// https://github.com\n\n/* eslint semi:2 */\n/* eslint-disable */\nfoo\n/* eslint-enable */\n// eslint-disable-next-line\nbaz\nbar // eslint-disable-line\n\n\"never\"\n\nUsing the\"never\"option means that this rule will report any comments which start with an uppercase letter.\n\nExamples ofincorrectcode with the\"never\"option:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"never\"] */\n\n// Capitalized comment\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode with the\"never\"option:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"never\"] */\n\n// lowercase comment\n\n// 1. Non-letter at beginning of comment\n\n// 丈 Non-Latin character at beginning of comment\n\nignorePattern\n\nTheignorePatternobject takes a string value, which is used as a regular expression applied to the first word of a comment.\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode with the\"ignorePattern\"option set to\"pragma\":\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"ignorePattern\": \"pragma\" }] */\n\nfunction foo() {\n    /* pragma wrap(true) */\n}\n\nignoreInlineComments\n\nSetting theignoreInlineCommentsoption totruemeans that comments in the middle of code (with a token on the same line as the beginning of the comment, and another token on the same line as the end of the comment) will not be reported by this rule.\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode with the\"ignoreInlineComments\"option set totrue:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"ignoreInlineComments\": true }] */\n\nfunction foo(/* ignored */ a) {\n}\n\nignoreConsecutiveComments\n\nIf theignoreConsecutiveCommentsoption is set totrue, then comments which otherwise violate the rule will not be reported as long as they immediately follow another comment. This can be applied more than once.\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode withignoreConsecutiveCommentsset totrue:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"ignoreConsecutiveComments\": true }] */\n\nfoo();\n// This comment is valid since it has the correct capitalization.\n// this comment is ignored since it follows another comment,\n// and this one as well because it follows yet another comment.\n\nbar();\n/* Here is a block comment which has the correct capitalization, */\n/* but this one is ignored due to being consecutive; */\n/*\n * in fact, even if any of these are multi-line, that is fine too.\n */\n\nExamples ofincorrectcode withignoreConsecutiveCommentsset totrue:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"ignoreConsecutiveComments\": true }] */\n\nfoo();\n// this comment is invalid, but only on this line.\n// this comment does NOT get reported, since it is a consecutive comment.\n\nUse Different Options for Line and Block Comments\n\nIf you wish to have a different configuration for line comments and block comments, you can do so by using two different object configurations (note that the capitalization option will be enforced consistently for line and block comments):\n\n{\n    \"capitalized-comments\": [\n        \"error\",\n        \"always\",\n        {\n            \"line\": {\n                \"ignorePattern\": \"pragma|ignored\",\n            },\n            \"block\": {\n                \"ignoreInlineComments\": true,\n                \"ignorePattern\": \"ignored\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nExamples ofincorrectcode with different line and block comment configuration:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"block\": { \"ignorePattern\": \"blockignore\" } }] */\n\n// capitalized line comment, this is incorrect, blockignore does not help here\n/* lowercased block comment, this is incorrect too */\n\nExamples ofcorrectcode with different line and block comment configuration:\n\n/* eslint capitalized-comments: [\"error\", \"always\", { \"block\": { \"ignorePattern\": \"blockignore\" } }] */\n\n// Uppercase line comment, this is correct\n/* blockignore lowercase block comment, this is correct due to ignorePattern */"
