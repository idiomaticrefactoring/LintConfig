    "summary": "Avoid negation within an \"if\" expression with an \"else\" clause.  For example, rephrase:\n`if (x != y) diff(); else same();` as: `if (x == y) same(); else diff();`.\n\nMost \"if (x != y)\" cases without an \"else\" are often return cases, so consistent use of this\nrule makes the code easier to read.  Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such\nas \"does the error case go first?\" or \"does the common case go first?\".\n\nSince null checks are commonly considered a positive condition, they are by default ignored\nby this rule. This means both `a == null` and `a != null` are allowed. If you want\nto enforce either style and disallow the other, use the property `nullCheckBranch`.",
