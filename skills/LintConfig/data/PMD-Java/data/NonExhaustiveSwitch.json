This can be achieved by adding a `default` case, or,\nif the switch is on an enum type, by ensuring there is one switch branch\nfor each enum constant.\n\nThis rule doesn't consider Switch Statements, that use Pattern Matching, since for these the\ncompiler already ensures that all cases are covered. The same is true for Switch Expressions,\nwhich are also not considered by this rule.",
