    "summary": "This rule detects methods called `setUp()` that are not properly annotated as a setup method.\nThis is primarily intended to assist in upgrading from JUnit 3, where setup methods were required to be called `setUp()`.\nTo a lesser extent, this may help detect omissions even under newer JUnit versions or under TestNG,\nas long as you are following this convention to name the methods.\n\n* JUnit 4 will only execute methods annotated with `@Before` before all tests.\n* JUnit 5 introduced `@BeforeEach` and `@BeforeAll` annotations to execute methods before each test or before all\ntests in the class, respectively.\n* TestNG provides the annotations `@BeforeMethod` and `@BeforeClass` to execute methods before each test or before\ntests in the class, respectively.\n\nNote: This rule was named JUnit4TestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation before PMD 7.7.0.",
