    "summary": "Reports parameters of methods and constructors that are not referenced them in the method body.\nParameters whose name starts with `ignored` or `unused` are filtered out.\n\nRemoving unused formal parameters from public methods could cause a ripple effect through the code base.\nHence, by default, this rule only considers private methods. To include non-private methods, set the\n`checkAll` property to `true`. The same applies to public constructors.",
