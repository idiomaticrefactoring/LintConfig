Most importantly,\nif two instances are equal, then they must have the same hash code. Using such invalid instances in hash-based\ncollections like `HashSet` or `HashMap` could lead to duplicated or missing entries.\n\nThis rule does not consider types that implement `Comparable`. There is a separate rule\n{% rule OverrideBothEqualsAndHashCodeOnComparable %} for this.",
