    "summary": "Use of the term `assert` will conflict with newer versions of Java since it is a reserved word.\n\nSince Java 1.4, the token `assert` became a reserved word and using it as an identifier will\nresult in a compilation failure for Java 1.4 and later. This rule is therefore only useful\nfor old Java code before Java 1.4. It can be used to identify problematic code prior to a Java update.",
