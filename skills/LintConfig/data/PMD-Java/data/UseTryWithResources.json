    "summary": "Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end\nof the statement. It avoids the need of explicitly closing the resources in a finally block. Additionally exceptions\nare better handled: If an exception occurred both in the `try` block and `finally` block, then the exception from\nthe try block was suppressed. With the `try`-with-resources statement, the exception thrown from the try-block is\npreserved.",
