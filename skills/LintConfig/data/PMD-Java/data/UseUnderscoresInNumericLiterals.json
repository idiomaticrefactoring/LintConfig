    "summary": "Since Java 1.7, numeric literals can use underscores to separate digits. This rule enforces that\nnumeric literals above a certain length use these underscores to increase readability.\n\nThe rule only supports decimal (base 10) literals for now. The acceptable length under which literals\nare not required to have underscores is configurable via a property. Even under that length, underscores\nthat are misplaced (not making groups of 3 digits) are reported.",
