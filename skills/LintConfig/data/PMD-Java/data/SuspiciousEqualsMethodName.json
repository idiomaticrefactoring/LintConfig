    "summary": "The method name and parameter number are suspiciously close to `Object.equals`, which can denote an\nintention to override it. However, the method does not override `Object.equals`, but overloads it instead.\nOverloading `Object.equals` method is confusing for other programmers, error-prone and hard to maintain,\nespecially when using inheritance, because `@Override` annotations used in subclasses can provide a false\nsense of security. For more information on `Object.equals` method, see Effective Java, 3rd Edition,\nItem 10: Obey the general contract when overriding equals.",
