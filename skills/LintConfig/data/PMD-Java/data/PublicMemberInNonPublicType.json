    "summary": "A non-public type should not declare its own members as public, as their visibility is effectively limited\nto private, package-private, or protected, making the use of the public modifier misleading.\nDeclaring members as public within a non-public type creates confusion and can lead to unintended consequences\nif the type is later made public, as this would expose all its public members.\nHowever, it is acceptable for a non-public type to inherit public members from a superclass, as this is part of\nthe superclass's design.\n\nTo avoid such issues, these members should be declared as protected, package-private, or even private,\nas appropriate. Note that altering the visibility of such members might unintentionally affect the API\nof a public subtype. Specifically, a public subtype of a package-private supertype inherits all public\nmethods of the supertype. Converting these methods to private removes them from the subtype as well, which\ncan inadvertently change the subtype's public API.",
