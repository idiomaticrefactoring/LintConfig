    "summary": "An operation on an immutable object will not change the object itself since the result of the operation is a new object.\nTherefore, ignoring the result of such an operation is likely a mistake. The operation can probably be removed.\n\nThis rule recognizes the types `String`, `BigDecimal`, `BigInteger` or any type from `java.time.*` as immutable.\n\n**Deprecated:** This rule is deprecated since PMD 7.17.0 and will be removed with PMD 8.0.0.\nThis rule has been replaced by {% rule UselessPureMethodCall %}.",
