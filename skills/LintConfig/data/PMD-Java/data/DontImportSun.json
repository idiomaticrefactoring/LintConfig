These packages are not portable\nand are likely to change.\n\nIf you find yourself having to depend on Sun APIs, confine this dependency to as\nsmall a scope as possible, for instance by writing a stable wrapper class around\nthe unstable API. You can then suppress this rule in the implementation of the wrapper.\n\n**Deprecated:** This rule is deprecated since PMD 7.21.0 and will be removed with PMD 8.0.0.\nThis rule has been replaced by {% rule UnsupportedJdkApiUsage %}.",
