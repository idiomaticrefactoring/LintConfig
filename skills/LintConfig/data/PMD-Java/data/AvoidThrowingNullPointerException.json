    "summary": "Avoid throwing NullPointerExceptions manually. These are confusing because most people will assume that the\nvirtual machine threw it.  To avoid a method being called with a null parameter, you may consider\nusing an IllegalArgumentException instead, making it clearly seen as a programmer-initiated exception.\nHowever, there are better ways to handle this:\n\n>*Effective Java, 3rd Edition, Item 72: Favor the use of standard exceptions*\n>\n>Arguably, every erroneous method invocation boils down to an illegal argument or state,\nbut other exceptions are standardly used for certain kinds of illegal arguments and states.\nIf a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited, convention dictates that\nNullPointerException be thrown rather than IllegalArgumentException.\n\nTo implement that, you are encouraged to use `java.util.Objects.requireNonNull()`\n(introduced in Java 1.7). This method is designed primarily for doing parameter\nvalidation in methods and constructors with multiple parameters.\n\nYour parameter validation could thus look like the following:\n```\npublic class Foo {\nprivate String exampleValue;\n\nvoid setExampleValue(String exampleValue) {\n// check, throw and assignment in a single standard call\nthis.exampleValue = Objects.requireNonNull(exampleValue, \"exampleValue must not be null!\");\n}\n}\n```",
