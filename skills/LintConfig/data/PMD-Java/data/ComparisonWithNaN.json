To test whether a\nvalue is the NaN value, one should instead use `Double.isNaN(someDouble)`\n(or `Float.isNaN`). The `!=` operator should be treated similarly.\nFinally, comparisons like `someDouble <= Double.NaN` are nonsensical\nand will always evaluate to false.\n\nThis rule has been renamed from \"BadComparison\" in PMD 6.36.0.",
