This rule attempts to determine the total number the characters that are actually\npassed into StringBuffer.append(), but represents a best guess \"worst case\" scenario. An empty\nStringBuffer/StringBuilder constructor initializes the object to 16 characters. This default\nis assumed if the length of the constructor can not be determined.",
