    "summary": "This rule detects methods called `tearDown()` that are not properly annotated as a cleanup method.\nThis is primarily intended to assist in upgrading from JUnit 3, where tear down methods were required to be called `tearDown()`.\nTo a lesser extent, this may help detect omissions even under newer JUnit versions or under TestNG,\nas long as you are following this convention to name the methods.\n\n* JUnit 4 will only execute methods annotated with `@After` after running each test.\n* JUnit 5 introduced `@AfterEach` and `@AfterAll` annotations to execute methods after each test or after\nall tests in the class, respectively.\n* TestNG provides the annotations `@AfterMethod` and `@AfterClass` to execute methods after each test or after\ntests in the class, respectively.\n\nNote: This rule was named JUnit4TestShouldUseAfterAnnotation before PMD 7.7.0.",
