    "summary": "If a class is marked as `Serializable`, then all fields need to be serializable as well. In order to exclude\na field, it can be marked as transient. Static fields are not considered.\n\nThis rule reports all fields, that are not serializable.\n\nIf a class implements the methods to perform manual serialization (`writeObject`, `readObject`) or uses\na replacement object (`writeReplace`, `readResolve`) then this class is ignored.\n\nNote: This rule has been revamped with PMD 6.52.0. It was previously called \"BeanMembersShouldSerialize\".\nThe property `prefix` has been deprecated, since in a serializable class all fields have to be\nserializable regardless of the name.",
