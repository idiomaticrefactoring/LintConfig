    "summary": "This rule reports suppression comments and annotations that did not suppress any PMD violation.\nNote that violations of this rule cannot be suppressed.\n\nPlease note:\n- The rule will report those suppressions comments/annotations that did not suppress a violation\n_during the current run_. That means you cannot run this rule separately from other rules, it must\nalways be run with all the rules that could produce a warning. This is most likely not a problem, as\nyou can just include this rule in your regular ruleset.\n- The rule for now only reports annotations specific to PMD, like `@SuppressWarnings(\"PMD\")`. For instance\n`@SuppressWarnings(\"all\")` is never reported as we cannot know if another tool is producing a\nwarning there that must be suppressed. In the future we might be able to check for other common ones\nlike `@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")` or `\"fallthrough\"`.",
