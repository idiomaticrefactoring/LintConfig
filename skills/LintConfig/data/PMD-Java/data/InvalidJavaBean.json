    "summary": "Identifies beans, that don't follow the [JavaBeans API specification](https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/7224-javabeans-1.01-fr-spec-oth-JSpec/).\n\nEach non-static field should have both a getter and a setter method. If the field is just used internally and is not\na bean property, then the field should be marked as `transient`.\n\nThe rule verifies that the type of the field is the same as the result type of the getter. And that this type matches\nthe type used in the setter.\n\nThe rule also checks, that there is a no-arg or default constructor available.\n\nOptionally the rule also verifies, that the bean implements `java.io.Serializable`. While this is a requirement for the\noriginal JavaBeans specification, frameworks nowadays don't strictly require this anymore.\n\nIn order to avoid many false positives in classes that are not beans, the rule needs to be explicitly\nenabled by configuring the property `packages`.",
