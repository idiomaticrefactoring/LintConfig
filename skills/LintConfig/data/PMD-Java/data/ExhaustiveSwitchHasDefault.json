    "summary": "When switching over an enum or sealed class, the compiler will ensure that all possible cases are covered.\nIf a case is missing, this will result in a compilation error. But if a default case is added, this compiler\ncheck is not performed anymore, leading to difficulties in noticing bugs at runtime.\n\nNot using a default case makes sure, a compiler error is introduced whenever a new enum constant or a\nnew subclass to the sealed class hierarchy is added. We will discover this problem at compile time\nrather than at runtime (if at all).\n\nNote: The fix it not necessarily just removing the default case. Maybe a case is missing which needs to be implemented.",
