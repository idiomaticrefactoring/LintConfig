    "summary": "Use of the term `enum` will conflict with newer versions of Java since it is a reserved word.\n\nSince Java 1.5, the token `enum` became a reserved word and using it as an identifier will\nresult in a compilation failure for Java 1.5 and later. This rule is therefore only useful\nfor old Java code before Java 1.5. It can be used to identify problematic code prior to a Java update.",
