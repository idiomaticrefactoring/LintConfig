    "summary": "When accessing private fields / methods from another class, the Java compiler will generate accessor methods\nwith package-private visibility. This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can\nbe avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.\n\n\n_Note:_ This rule is only executed for Java 10 or lower.\nSince Java 11, [JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Control](https://openjdk.org/jeps/181) has been implemented. This\nmeans that in Java 11 and above accessor classes are not generated anymore.",
