    "summary": "Non-private static fields should be made constants (or immutable references) by\ndeclaring them final.\n\nNon-private non-final static fields break encapsulation and can lead to hard to find\nbugs, since these fields can be modified from anywhere within the program.\nCallers can trivially access and modify non-private non-final static fields. Neither\naccesses nor modifications can be guarded against, and newly set values cannot\nbe validated.\n\nIf you are using this rule, then you don't need this\nrule {% rule java/errorprone/AssignmentToNonFinalStatic %}.",
