    "summary": "Enforces the modifier order recommended by the JLS. Apart from sorting modifiers,\nthis rule also enforces that all annotations appear before all modifier keywords.\nBy setting the property `typeAnnotations`, you can also enforce that type\nannotations appear right of the modifier keywords, next to the type they apply to.\nThis property can have three values:\n- `onType`: Type annotations must be placed next to the type they apply to\n- `onDecl`: Type annotations must be placed with other annotations, before modifiers.\nThis is not enforced if the type annotations syntactically appears within the type, e.g.\nin `public Map.@Nullable Entry<K,V> method()` or `public <T> @NonNull T method()`.\n- `anywhere` (default): Either position fits. They still cannot be interspersed within keyword\nmodifiers. Annotations that are not type annotations are still required to be before keyword\nmodifiers.",
