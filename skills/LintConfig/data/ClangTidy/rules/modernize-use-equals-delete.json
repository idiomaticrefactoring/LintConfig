        "description": "Description\n\nIdentifies unimplemented private special member functions, and recommends using\n=\ndelete\nfor them. Additionally, it recommends relocating any deleted\nmember function from the\nprivate\nto the\npublic\nsection.\n\nBefore the introduction of C++11, the primary method to effectively “erase” a\nparticular function involved declaring it as\nprivate\nwithout providing a\ndefinition. This approach would result in either a compiler error (when\nattempting to call a private function) or a linker error (due to an undefined\nreference).\n\nHowever, subsequent to the advent of C++11, a more conventional approach\nemerged for achieving this purpose. It involves flagging functions as\n=\ndelete\nand keeping them in the\npublic\nsection of the class.\n\nTo prevent false positives, this check is only active within a translation\nunit where all other member functions have been implemented. The check will\ngenerate partial fixes by introducing\n=\ndelete\n, but the user is responsible\nfor manually relocating functions to the\npublic\nsection.\n\n// Example: bad\nclass\nA\n{\nprivate\n:\nA\n(\nconst\nA\n&\n);\nA\n&\noperator\n=\n(\nconst\nA\n&\n);\n};\n// Example: good\nclass\nA\n{\npublic\n:\nA\n(\nconst\nA\n&\n)\n=\ndelete\n;\nA\n&\noperator\n=\n(\nconst\nA\n&\n)\n=\ndelete\n;\n};\n\nIgnoreMacros\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n(default is\ntrue\n), the check will not warn\nabout functions declared inside macros.",
