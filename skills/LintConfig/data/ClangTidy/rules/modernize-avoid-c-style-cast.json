        "description": "Description\n\nFinds usages of C-style casts.\n\nC-style casts can perform a variety of different conversions (\nconst_cast\n,\nstatic_cast\n,\nreinterpret_cast\n, or a combination). This makes them\ndangerous as the intent is not clear, and they can silently perform unsafe\nconversions between incompatible types.\n\nThis check is similar to\n-Wold-style-cast\n, but it suggests automated fixes\nin some cases. The reported locations should not be different from the ones\ngenerated by\n-Wold-style-cast\n.\n\nExamples\nclass\nA\n{\npublic\n:\nstd\n::\nstring\nv\n;\n};\nA\na\n;\ndouble\n*\nnum\n=\n(\ndouble\n*\n)(\n&\na\n);\n// Compiles! Hides danger\n// num = static_cast<double*>(&a);     // Won't compile (good!)\nnum\n=\nreinterpret_cast\n<\ndouble\n*>\n(\n&\na\n);\n// Compiles, danger is explicit\n\nReferences\nCorresponding cpplint.py check name:\nreadability/casting\n.",
