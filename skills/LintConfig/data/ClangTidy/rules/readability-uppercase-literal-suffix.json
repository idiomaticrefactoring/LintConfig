When the\nsuffix is found, a case-insensitive lookup in that list is made, and if a\nreplacement is found that is different from the current suffix, then the\ndiagnostic is issued. This allows for fine-grained control of what suffixes to\nconsider and what their replacements should be.\nExample\nGiven a list\nL;uL\n:\nl\n->\nL\nL\nwill be kept as is.\nul\n->\nuL\nUl\n->\nuL\nUL\n->\nuL\nuL\nwill be kept as is.\null\nwill be kept as is, since it is not in the list\nand so on.\nIgnoreMacros\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n(default is\ntrue\n), the check will not warn\nabout literal suffixes inside macros."
