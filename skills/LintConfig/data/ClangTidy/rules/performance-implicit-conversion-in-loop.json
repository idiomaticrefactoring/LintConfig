        "description": "Description\n\nThis warning appears in a range-based loop with a loop variable of const ref\ntype where the type of the variable does not match the one returned by the\niterator. This means that an implicit conversion happens, which can for example\nresult in expensive deep copies.\n\nExample:\n\nmap\n<\nint\n,\nvector\n<\nstring\n>>\nmy_map\n;\nfor\n(\nconst\npair\n<\nint\n,\nvector\n<\nstring\n>>&\np\n:\nmy_map\n)\n{}\n// The iterator type is in fact pair<const int, vector<string>>, which means\n// that the compiler added a conversion, resulting in a copy of the vectors.\n\nThe easiest solution is usually to use\nconst\nauto&\ninstead of writing the\ntype manually.",
