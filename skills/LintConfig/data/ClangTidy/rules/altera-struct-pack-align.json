Packing the struct will make it use\n// only 10 bytes of memory, and aligning it to 16 bytes will make it\n// efficient to access.\nstruct\nexample\n{\nchar\na\n;\n// 1 byte\ndouble\nb\n;\n// 8 bytes\nchar\nc\n;\n// 1 byte\n};\n// The following struct is arranged in such a way that packing is not needed.\n// However, it is aligned to 4 bytes instead of 8, and thus needs to be\n// explicitly aligned.\nstruct\nimplicitly_packed_example\n{\nchar\na\n;\n// 1 byte\nchar\nb\n;\n// 1 byte\nchar\nc\n;\n// 1 byte\nchar\nd\n;\n// 1 byte\nint\ne\n;\n// 4 bytes\n};\n// The following struct is explicitly aligned and packed.\nstruct\ngood_example\n{\nchar\na\n;\n// 1 byte\ndouble\nb\n;\n// 8 bytes\nchar\nc\n;\n// 1 byte\n}\n__attribute__\n((\npacked\n))\n__attribute__\n((\naligned\n(\n16\n));\n// Explicitly aligning a struct to the wrong value will result in a warning.\n// The following example should be aligned to 16 bytes, not 32.\nstruct\nbadly_aligned_example\n{\nchar\na\n;\n// 1 byte\ndouble\nb\n;\n// 8 bytes\nchar\nc\n;\n// 1 byte\n}\n__attribute__\n((\npacked\n))\n__attribute__\n((\naligned\n(\n32\n)));",
