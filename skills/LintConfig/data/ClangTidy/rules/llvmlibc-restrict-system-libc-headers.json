        "description": "Description\n\nFinds includes of system libc headers not provided by the compiler within\nllvm-libc implementations.\n\n#include\n<stdio.h>\n// Not allowed because it is part of system libc.\n#include\n<stddef.h>\n// Allowed because it is provided by the compiler.\n#include\n\"internal/stdio.h\"\n// Allowed because it is NOT part of system libc.\n\nThis check is necessary because accidentally including system libc headers can\nlead to subtle and hard to detect bugs. For example consider a system libc\nwhose\ndirent\nstruct has slightly different field ordering than llvm-libc.\nWhile this will compile successfully, this can cause issues during runtime\nbecause they are ABI incompatible.",
        "option": "Static analysis (Clang-Tidy) options are configured via .clang-tidy file.\n\nOptions\nIncludes\nA string containing a comma separated glob list of allowed include\nfilenames. Similar to the -checks glob list for running clang-tidy itself,\nthe two wildcard characters are\n*\nand\n-\n, to include and exclude globs,\nrespectively. The default is\n-*\n, which disallows all includes.\nThis can be used to allow known safe includes such as Linux development\nheaders. See\nportability-restrict-system-includes\nfor more\ndetails."
