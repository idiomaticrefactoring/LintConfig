        "description": "Description\n\nFinds macros that can have unexpected behavior due to missing parentheses.\n\nMacros are expanded by the preprocessor as-is. As a result, there can be\nunexpected behavior; operators may be evaluated in unexpected order and\nunary operators may become binary operators, etc.\n\nWhen the replacement list has an expression, it is recommended to surround\nit with parentheses. This ensures that the macro result is evaluated\ncompletely before it is used.\n\nIt is also recommended to surround macro arguments in the replacement list\nwith parentheses. This ensures that the argument value is calculated\nproperly.\n\nThis check corresponds to the CERT C Coding Standard rule\nPRE02-C. Macro replacement lists should be parenthesized.",
