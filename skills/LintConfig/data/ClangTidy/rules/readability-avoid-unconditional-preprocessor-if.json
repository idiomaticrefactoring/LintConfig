Dead code can make understanding the codebase more difficult,\nhinder readability, and may be a sign of unfinished functionality or abandoned\nfeatures. This can cause maintenance issues, confusion for future developers,\nand potential compilation problems.\n\nAs a solution for both cases, consider using preprocessor macros or defines,\nlike\n#ifdef\nDEBUGGING_ENABLED\n, to control code enabling or disabling.\nThis approach provides better coordination and flexibility when working with\ndifferent parts of the codebase. Alternatively, you can comment out the entire\ncode using\n/*\n*/\nblock comments and add a hint, such as\n@todo\n,\nto indicate future actions.",
