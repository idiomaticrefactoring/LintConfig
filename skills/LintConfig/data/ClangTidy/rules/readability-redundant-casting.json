        "description": "Description\n\nDetects explicit type casting operations that involve the same source and\ndestination types, and subsequently recommend their removal. Covers a range of\nexplicit casting operations, including\nstatic_cast\n,\nconst_cast\n, C-style\ncasts, and\nreinterpret_cast\n. Its primary objective is to enhance code\nreadability and maintainability by eliminating unnecessary type casting.\n\nint\nvalue\n=\n42\n;\nint\nresult\n=\nstatic_cast\n<\nint\n>\n(\nvalue\n);\n\nIn this example, the\nstatic_cast<int>(value)\nis redundant, as it performs\na cast from an\nint\nto another\nint\n.\n\nCasting operations involving constructor conversions, user-defined conversions,\nfunctional casts, type-dependent casts, casts between distinct type aliases\nthat refer to the same underlying type, as well as bitfield-related casts and\ncasts directly from lvalue to rvalue, are all disregarded by the check.",
        "option": "Static analysis (Clang-Tidy) options are configured via .clang-tidy file.\n\nOptions\nIgnoreMacros\nIf set to\ntrue\n, the check will not give warnings inside macros. Default\nis\ntrue\n.\nIgnoreTypeAliases\nWhen set to\nfalse\n, the check will consider type aliases, and when set to\ntrue\n, it will resolve all type aliases and operate on the underlying\ntypes. Default is\nfalse\n."
