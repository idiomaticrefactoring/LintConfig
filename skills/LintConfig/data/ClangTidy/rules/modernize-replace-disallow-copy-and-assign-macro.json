        "description": "Description\n\nFinds macro expansions of\nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(Type)\nand replaces them\nwith a deleted copy constructor and a deleted assignment operator.\n\nBefore the\ndelete\nkeyword was introduced in C++11 it was common practice to\ndeclare a copy constructor and an assignment operator as private members. This\neffectively makes them unusable to the public API of a class.\n\nWith the advent of the\ndelete\nkeyword in C++11 we can abandon the\nprivate\naccess of the copy constructor and the assignment operator and\ndelete the methods entirely.\n\nWhen running this check on a code like this:\n\nclass\nFoo\n{\nprivate\n:\nDISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN\n(\nFoo\n);\n};\n\nIt will be transformed to this:\n\nclass\nFoo\n{\nprivate\n:\nFoo\n(\nconst\nFoo\n&\n)\n=\ndelete\n;\nconst\nFoo\n&\noperator\n=\n(\nconst\nFoo\n&\n)\n=\ndelete\n;\n};\n\nLimitations\nNotice that the migration example above leaves the\nprivate\naccess\nspecification untouched. You might want to run the check\nmodernize-use-equals-delete\nto get warnings for deleted functions in private sections.",
