        "description": "Description\n\nFinds property declarations in Objective-C files that do not follow the pattern\nof property names in Apple’s programming guide. The property name should be\nin the format of Lower Camel Case.\n\nFor code:\n\n@property\n(\nnonatomic\n,\nassign\n)\nint\nLowerCamelCase\n;\n\nThe fix will be:\n\n@property\n(\nnonatomic\n,\nassign\n)\nint\nlowerCamelCase\n;\n\nThe check will only fix ‘CamelCase’ to ‘camelCase’. In some other cases we will\nonly provide warning messages since the property name could be complicated.\nUsers will need to come up with a proper name by their own.\n\nThis check also accepts special acronyms as prefixes or suffixes. Such prefixes\nor suffixes will suppress the Lower Camel Case check according to the guide:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001281-1002931-BBCFHEAB\n\nFor a full list of well-known acronyms:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/APIAbbreviations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001285-BCIHCGAE\n\nThe corresponding style rule:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingIvarsAndTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001284-1001757\n\nThe check will also accept property declared in category with a prefix of\nlowercase letters followed by a ‘_’ to avoid naming conflict. For example:\n\n@property\n(\nnonatomic\n,\nassign\n)\nint\nabc_lowerCamelCase\n;\n\nThe corresponding style rule:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1908/_index.html",
