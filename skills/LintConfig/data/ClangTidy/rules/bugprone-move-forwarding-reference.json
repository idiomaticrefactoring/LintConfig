However, this is not true. Consider this example:\nstd\n::\nstring\ns\n=\n\"Hello, world\"\n;\nfoo\n(\ns\n);\nThis code compiles and, after the call to\nfoo()\n,\ns\nis left in an\nindeterminate state because it has been moved from. This may be surprising to\nthe caller of\nfoo()\nbecause no\nstd::move\nwas used when calling\nfoo()\n.\nThe reason for this behavior lies in the special rule for template argument\ndeduction on function templates like\nfoo()\n– i.e. on function templates\nthat take an rvalue reference argument of a type that is a deduced function\ntemplate argument. (See section [temp.deduct.call]/3 in the C++11 standard.)\nIf\nfoo()\nis called on an lvalue (as in the example above), then\nT\nis\ndeduced to be an lvalue reference. In the example,\nT\nis deduced to be\nstd::string\n&\n. The type of the argument\nt\ntherefore becomes\nstd::string&\n&&\n; by the reference collapsing rules, this collapses to\nstd::string&\n.\nThis means that the\nfoo(s)\ncall passes\ns\nas an lvalue reference, and\nfoo()\nends up moving\ns\nand thereby placing it into an indeterminate\nstate.",
