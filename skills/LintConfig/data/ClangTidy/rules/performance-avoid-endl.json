In addition, flushing the stream buffer can\ncause additional overhead when working with streams that are buffered.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider the following code:\n\n#include\n<iostream>\nint\nmain\n()\n{\nstd\n::\ncout\n<<\n\"Hello\"\n<<\nstd\n::\nendl\n;\n}\n\nWhich gets transformed into:\n\n#include\n<iostream>\nint\nmain\n()\n{\nstd\n::\ncout\n<<\n\"Hello\"\n<<\n'\\n'\n;\n}\n\nThis code writes a single newline character to the\nstd::cout\nstream without\nflushing the stream buffer.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that the standard C++ streams (like\nstd::cerr\n,\nstd::wcerr\n,\nstd::clog\nand\nstd::wclog\n)\nalways flush after a write operation, unless\nstd::ios_base::sync_with_stdio\nis set to\nfalse\n. regardless of whether\nstd::endl\nor\n'\\n'\nis used.\nTherefore, using\n'\\n'\nwith these streams will not\nresult in any performance gain, but it is still recommended to use\n'\\n'\nfor consistency and readability.\n\nIf you do need to flush the stream buffer, you can use\nstd::flush\nexplicitly like this:\n\n#include\n<iostream>\nint\nmain\n()\n{\nstd\n::\ncout\n<<\n\"Hello\n\\n\n\"\n<<\nstd\n::\nflush\n;\n}",
