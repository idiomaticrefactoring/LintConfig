Relying on it can lead to portability issues in\nsome environments.\n\nSome older or specialized C/C++ compilers, particularly in embedded systems,\nmay not fully support\n#pragma\nonce\n.\n\nIt can also fail in certain file system configurations, like network drives\nor complex symbolic links, potentially leading to compilation issues.\n\nConsider the following header file:\n\n// my_header.h\n#pragma once\n// warning: avoid 'pragma once' directive; use include guards instead\n\nThe warning suggests using include guards:\n\n// my_header.h\n#ifndef PATH_TO_MY_HEADER_H\n// Good: use include guards.\n#define PATH_TO_MY_HEADER_H\n#endif\n// PATH_TO_MY_HEADER_H",
