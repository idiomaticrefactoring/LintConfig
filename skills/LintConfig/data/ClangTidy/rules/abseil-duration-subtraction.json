        "description": "Description\n\nChecks for cases where subtraction should be performed in the\nabsl::Duration\ndomain. When subtracting two values, and the first one is\nknown to be a conversion from\nabsl::Duration\n, we can infer that the second\nshould also be interpreted as an\nabsl::Duration\n, and make that inference\nexplicit.\n\nExamples:\n\n// Original - Subtraction in the double domain\ndouble\nx\n;\nabsl\n::\nDuration\nd\n;\ndouble\nresult\n=\nabsl\n::\nToDoubleSeconds\n(\nd\n)\n-\nx\n;\n// Suggestion - Subtraction in the absl::Duration domain instead\ndouble\nresult\n=\nabsl\n::\nToDoubleSeconds\n(\nd\n-\nabsl\n::\nSeconds\n(\nx\n));\n// Original - Subtraction of two Durations in the double domain\nabsl\n::\nDuration\nd1\n,\nd2\n;\ndouble\nresult\n=\nabsl\n::\nToDoubleSeconds\n(\nd1\n)\n-\nabsl\n::\nToDoubleSeconds\n(\nd2\n);\n// Suggestion - Subtraction in the absl::Duration domain instead\ndouble\nresult\n=\nabsl\n::\nToDoubleSeconds\n(\nd1\n-\nd2\n);\n\nNote: As with other\nclang-tidy\nchecks, it is possible that multiple fixes\nmay overlap (as in the case of nested expressions), so not all occurrences can\nbe transformed in one run. In particular, this may occur for nested subtraction\nexpressions. Running\nclang-tidy\nmultiple times will find and fix these\noverlaps.",
