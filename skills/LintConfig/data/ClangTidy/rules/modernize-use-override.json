        "description": "Description\n\nAdds\noverride\n(introduced in C++11) to overridden virtual functions and\nremoves\nvirtual\nfrom those functions as it is not required.\n\nvirtual\non non base class implementations was used to help indicate to the\nuser that a function was virtual. C++ compilers did not use the presence of\nthis to signify an overridden function.\n\nIn C++11\noverride\nand\nfinal\nkeywords were introduced to allow\noverridden functions to be marked appropriately. Their presence allows\ncompilers to verify that an overridden function correctly overrides a base\nclass implementation.\n\nThis can be useful as compilers can generate a compile time error when:\n\nThe base class implementation function signature changes.\nThe user has not created the override with the correct signature.",
        "option": "Static analysis (Clang-Tidy) options are configured via .clang-tidy file.\n\nOptions\nIgnoreDestructors\nIf set to\ntrue\n, this check will not diagnose destructors. Default is\nfalse\n.\nIgnoreTemplateInstantiations\nIf set to\ntrue\n, instructs this check to ignore virtual function overrides\nthat are part of template instantiations. Default is\nfalse\n.\nAllowOverrideAndFinal\nIf set to\ntrue\n, this check will not diagnose\noverride\nas redundant\nwith\nfinal\n.
