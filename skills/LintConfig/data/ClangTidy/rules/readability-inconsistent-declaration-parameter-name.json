With this check, we\ncan easily find and correct such inconsistencies, keeping declaration and\ndefinition always in sync.\n\nUnnamed parameters are allowed and are not taken into account when comparing\nfunction declarations, for example:\n\nvoid\nfoo\n(\nint\na\n);\nvoid\nfoo\n(\nint\n);\n// no warning\n\nOne name is also allowed to be a case-insensitive prefix/suffix of the other:\n\nvoid\nfoo\n(\nint\ncount\n);\nvoid\nfoo\n(\nint\ncount_input\n)\n{\n// no warning\nint\ncount\n=\nadjustCount\n(\ncount_input\n);\n}\n\nTo help with refactoring, in some cases fix-it hints are generated to align\nparameter names to a single naming convention. This works with the assumption\nthat the function definition is the most up-to-date version, as it directly\nreferences parameter names in its body. Example:\n\nvoid\nfoo\n(\nint\na\n);\n// warning and fix-it hint (replace \"a\" to \"b\")\nint\nfoo\n(\nint\nb\n)\n{\nreturn\nb\n+\n2\n;\n}\n// definition with use of \"b\"\n\nIn the case of multiple redeclarations or function template specializations,\na warning is issued for every redeclaration or specialization inconsistent with\nthe definition or the first declaration seen in a translation unit.",
        "option": "Static analysis (Clang-Tidy) options are configured via .clang-tidy file.\n\nOptions\nIgnoreMacros\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n(default is\ntrue\n), the check will not warn\nabout names declared inside macros.\nStrict\nIf this option is set to\ntrue\n(default is\nfalse\n), then names must match\nexactly (or be absent)."
