Suppose you have code like the following:\n// Two owners with assigned resources\ngsl\n::\nowner\n<\nint\n*>\nOwner1\n=\nnew\nint\n(\n42\n);\ngsl\n::\nowner\n<\nint\n*>\nOwner2\n=\nnew\nint\n(\n42\n);\nOwner2\n=\nOwner1\n;\n// Conceptual Leak of initial resource of Owner2!\nOwner1\n=\nnullptr\n;\nThe semantic of a\ngsl::owner<T*>\nis mostly like a\nstd::unique_ptr<T>\n,\ntherefore assignment of two\ngsl::owner<T*>\nis considered a move, which\nrequires that the resource\nOwner2\nmust have been released before the\nassignment. This kind of condition could be caught in later improvements of\nthis check with flowsensitive analysis. Currently, the\nClang Static Analyzer\ncatches this bug for dynamic memory, but not for general types of resources."
