Having redundant declarations could in worst\ncase mean that there are typos in the code that cause bugs.\n\nNormally the code can be automatically fixed,\nclang-tidy\ncan remove\nthe second declaration. However there are 2 cases when you need to fix the code\nmanually:\n\nWhen the declarations are in different header files;\nWhen multiple variables are declared together.",
