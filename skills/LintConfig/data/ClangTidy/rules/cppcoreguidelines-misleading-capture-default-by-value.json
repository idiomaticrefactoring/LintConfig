        "description": "Description\n\nWarns when lambda specify a by-value capture default and capture\nthis\n.\n\nBy-value capture defaults in member functions can be misleading about whether\ndata members are captured by value or reference. This occurs because specifying\nthe capture default\n[=]\nactually captures the\nthis\npointer by value,\nnot the data members themselves. As a result, data members are still indirectly\naccessed via the captured\nthis\npointer, which essentially means they are\nbeing accessed by reference. Therefore, even when using\n[=]\n, data members\nare effectively captured by reference, which might not align with the user’s\nexpectations.\n\nExamples:\n\nstruct\nAClass\n{\nint\nmember\n;\nvoid\nmisleadingLogic\n()\n{\nint\nlocal\n=\n0\n;\nmember\n=\n0\n;\nauto\nf\n=\n[\n=\n]()\nmutable\n{\nlocal\n+=\n1\n;\nmember\n+=\n1\n;\n};\nf\n();\n// Here, local is 0 but member is 1\n}\nvoid\nclearLogic\n()\n{\nint\nlocal\n=\n0\n;\nmember\n=\n0\n;\nauto\nf\n=\n[\nthis\n,\nlocal\n]()\nmutable\n{\nlocal\n+=\n1\n;\nmember\n+=\n1\n;\n};\nf\n();\n// Here, local is 0 but member is 1\n}\n};\n\nThis check implements\nF.54\nfrom the C++ Core Guidelines.",
