        "description": "Description\n\nFinds declarations of\ndispatch_once_t\nvariables without static or global\nstorage. The behavior of using\ndispatch_once_t\npredicates with automatic or\ndynamic storage is undefined by libdispatch, and should be avoided.\n\nIt is a common pattern to have functions initialize internal static or global\ndata once when the function runs, but programmers have been known to miss the\nstatic on the\ndispatch_once_t\npredicate, leading to an uninitialized flag\nvalue at the mercy of the stack.\n\nProgrammers have also been known to make\ndispatch_once_t\nvariables be\nmembers of structs or classes, with the intent to lazily perform some expensive\nstruct or class member initialization only once; however, this violates the\nlibdispatch requirements.\n\nSee the discussion section of\nApple’s dispatch_once documentation\nfor more information.",
