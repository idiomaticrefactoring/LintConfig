Common fixes include:\n\nMaking the\nreset\nmethod polymorphic\nRe-naming\nDerived::reset\nif it’s not meant to intersect with\nBase::reset\nUsing\nusing\nBase::reset\nto change the access specifier\n\nThis is also a violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.\n\nstruct\nBase\n{\nvoid\nreset\n()\n{\n/* reset the base class */\n};\n};\nstruct\nDerived\n:\npublic\nBase\n{\nvoid\nreset\n()\n{\n/* reset the derived class, but not the base class */\n};\n};",
