Function putenv does not copy the passed\nstring, only a pointer to the data is stored and this data can be read even by\nother threads. Content of a stack-allocated array is likely to be overwritten\nafter exiting from the function.\nThe\nclang-analyzer-security.PutenvStackArray\ncheck is an alias, please see\nClang Static Analyzer Available Checkers\nfor more information.",
