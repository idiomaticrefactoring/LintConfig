Asynchronous cancellation type\n(\nPTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS\n) is generally unsafe, use type\nPTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED\ninstead which is the default. Even with deferred\ncancellation, a cancellation point in an asynchronous signal handler may still\nbe acted upon and the effect is as if it was an asynchronous cancellation.\n\npthread_setcanceltype\n(\nPTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS\n,\n&\noldtype\n);\n\nThis check corresponds to the CERT C Coding Standard rule\nPOS47-C. Do not use threads that can be canceled asynchronously\n.\n\ncert-pos47-c\nredirects here as an alias of this check.",
