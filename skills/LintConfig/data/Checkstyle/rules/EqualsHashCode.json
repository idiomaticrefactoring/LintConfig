{"EqualsHashCode": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks that classes that either override equals()\nor hashCode() also overrides the other.\nThis check only verifies that the method declarations match\nObject.equals(Object) and Object.hashCode() exactly to be\nconsidered an override. This check does not verify invalid method names, parameters\nother than Object, or anything else.\n\n\nRationale: The contract of equals() and\nhashCode() requires that equal objects\nhave the same hashCode. Therefore, whenever you override\nequals() you must override hashCode()\nto ensure that your class can be used in hash-based collections.", "option": ""}}
