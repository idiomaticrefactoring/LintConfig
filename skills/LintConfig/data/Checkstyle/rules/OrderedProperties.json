{"OrderedProperties": {"description": "Description\n\nDetects if keys in properties files are in correct order.\n\n\nRationale: Sorted properties make it easy for people to find required properties by name\nin file. This makes it easier to merge. While there are no problems at runtime.\nThis check is valuable only on files with string resources where order of lines\ndoes not matter at all, but this can be improved.\nE.g.: checkstyle/src/main/resources/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/messages.properties\nYou may suppress warnings of this check for files that have a logical structure like\nbuild files or log4j configuration files. See SuppressionFilter.\n\n<suppress checks=\"OrderedProperties\"\nfiles=\"log4j.properties|ResourceBundle/Bug.*.properties|logging.properties\"/>\n\n\n\nKnown limitation: The key should not contain a newline.\nThe string compare will work, but not the line number reporting.", "option": "\nfileExtensions, Specify the file extensions of the files to process., String[], .properties"}}
