First the public class variables, then\nprotected, then package level (no access modifier), and then\nprivate.\n\n\nInstance variables.

For example:\n\n\n\npublic class A {\nprivate double x = 1.0;\nprivate double y = 2.0;\npublic double slope = x / y; // will be skipped from validation due to forward reference\n}", "option": "\nignoreConstructors, Control whether to ignore constructors., boolean, false\nignoreModifiers, Control whether to ignore modifiers (fields, ...)., boolean, false"}}
