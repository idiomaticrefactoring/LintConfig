{"JavaNCSS": {"description": "Description\n\nDetermines complexity of methods, classes and files by\ncounting the Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS). This\ncheck adheres to the\nspecification for the\nJavaNCSS-Tool\nwritten by Chr. Clemens Lee.\n\n\nRoughly said the NCSS metric is calculated by\ncounting the source lines which are not comments, (nearly)\nequivalent to counting the semicolons and opening curly braces.\n\n\nThe NCSS for a class is summarized from the NCSS\nof all its methods, the NCSS of its nested classes and the\nnumber of member variable declarations.\n\n\nThe NCSS for a file is summarized from the ncss of all its top level classes,\nthe number of imports and the package declaration.\n\n\nRationale: Too large methods and classes are hard to read and\ncostly to maintain. A large NCSS number often means that a\nmethod or class has too many responsibilities and/or\nfunctionalities which should be decomposed into smaller units.", "option": "\nclassMaximum, Specify the maximum allowed number of non commenting lines in a class., int, 1500\nfileMaximum, Specify the maximum allowed number of non commenting lines in a file including all top level and nested classes., int, 2000\nmethodMaximum, Specify the maximum allowed number of non commenting lines in a method., int, 50\nrecordMaximum, Specify the maximum allowed number of non commenting lines in a record., int, 150"}}
