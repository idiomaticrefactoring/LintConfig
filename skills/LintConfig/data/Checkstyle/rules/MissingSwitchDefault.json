{"MissingSwitchDefault": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks that switch statement has a default clause.\n\n\nRationale: It's usually a good idea to introduce a default case in\nevery switch statement. Even if the developer is sure that all\ncurrently possible cases are covered, this should be expressed in\nthe default branch, e.g. by using an assertion. This way the code is\nprotected against later changes, e.g. introduction of new types in an\nenumeration type.\n\n\nThis check does not validate any switch expressions. Rationale:\nThe compiler requires switch expressions to be exhaustive. This means\nthat all possible inputs must be covered.\n\n\nThis check does not validate switch statements that use pattern or null\nlabels. Rationale: Switch statements that use pattern or null labels are\nchecked by the compiler for exhaustiveness. This means that all possible\ninputs must be covered.\n\n\nSee the\n\nJava Language Specification for more information about switch statements\nand expressions.", "option": ""}}
