{"ThrowsCount": {"description": "Description\n\nRestricts throws statements to a specified count.\nMethods with \"Override\" or \"java.lang.Override\" annotation are skipped\nfrom validation as current class cannot change signature of these methods.\n\n\nRationale: Exceptions form part of a method's interface. Declaring a\nmethod to throw too many differently rooted exceptions makes\nexception handling onerous and leads to poor programming practices\nsuch as writing code like catch(Exception ex).\n4 is the empirical value which is based on reports that we had for\nthe ThrowsCountCheck over big projects such as OpenJDK.\nThis check also forces developers to put exceptions into a hierarchy\nsuch that in the simplest case, only one type of exception need be\nchecked for by a caller but any subclasses can be caught specifically\nif necessary.
