{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks cyclomatic complexity against a specified limit.\nIt is a measure of the minimum number of\npossible paths through the source and therefore the number of\nrequired tests, it is not about quality of code!\nIt is only applied to methods, c-tors,\n\nstatic initializers and instance initializers.\n\n\nThe complexity is equal to the number of decision points  + 1.\nDecision points: if, while\n, do, for, ?:, catch\n, switch, case\nstatements and operators && and ||\nin the body of target.\n\n\nBy pure theory level 1-4 is considered easy to test, 5-7 OK, 8-10\nconsider re-factoring to ease testing, and 11+ re-factor now as testing will be painful.\n\n\nWhen it comes to code quality measurement by this metric\nlevel 10 is very good level as a ultimate target (that is hard to archive).\nDo not be ashamed to have complexity level 15 or even higher,\nbut keep it below 20 to catch really bad-designed code automatically.\n\n\nPlease use Suppression to avoid violations on cases that could not be split in few\nmethods without damaging readability of code or encapsulation.", "option": "\nmax, Specify the maximum threshold allowed., int, 10\nswitchBlockAsSingleDecisionPoint, Control whether to treat the whole switch block as a single decision point., boolean, false\ntokens, tokens to check, subset of tokens\n\nLITERAL_WHILE\n,\nLITERAL_DO\n,\nLITERAL_FOR\n,\nLITERAL_IF\n,\nLITERAL_SWITCH\n,\nLITERAL_CASE\n,\nLITERAL_CATCH\n,\nQUESTION\n,\nLAND\n,\nLOR\n.\n,\n\nLITERAL_WHILE\n,\nLITERAL_DO\n,\nLITERAL_FOR\n,\nLITERAL_IF\n,\nLITERAL_SWITCH\n,\nLITERAL_CASE\n,\nLITERAL_CATCH\n,\nQUESTION\n,\nLAND\n,\nLOR\n.\n"}}
