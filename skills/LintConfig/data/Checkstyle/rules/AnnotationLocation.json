This check also verifies that the annotations are on the same indenting level as\nthe annotated element if they are not on the same line.\n\n\nAttention: Elements that cannot have JavaDoc comments like local variables are not in the\nscope of this check even though a token type like VARIABLE_DEF would match\nthem.\n\n\nAttention: Annotations among modifiers are ignored (looks like false-negative)\nas there might be a problem with annotations for return types:\n\n\npublic @Nullable Long getStartTimeOrNull() { ... }\n\nSuch annotations are better to keep close to type.\nDue to limitations, Checkstyle can not examine the target of an annotation.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n@Override\n@Nullable\npublic String getNameIfPresent() { ... }", "option": "\nallowSamelineMultipleAnnotations, Allow annotation(s) to be located on the same line as target element., boolean, false\nallowSamelineParameterizedAnnotation, Allow one and only parameterized annotation to be located on the same line as target element., boolean, false\nallowSamelineSingleParameterlessAnnotation, Allow single parameterless annotation to be located on the same line as target element., boolean, true\ntokens, tokens to check, subset of tokens\n\nCLASS_DEF\n,\nINTERFACE_DEF\n,\nPACKAGE_DEF\n,\nENUM_CONSTANT_DEF\n,\nENUM_DEF\n,\nMETHOD_DEF\n,\nCTOR_DEF\n,\nVARIABLE_DEF\n,\nANNOTATION_DEF\n,\nANNOTATION_FIELD_DEF\n,\nRECORD_DEF\n,\nCOMPACT_CTOR_DEF\n.\n,\n\nCLASS_DEF\n,\nINTERFACE_DEF\n,\nPACKAGE_DEF\n,\nENUM_CONSTANT_DEF\n,\nENUM_DEF\n,\nMETHOD_DEF\n,\nCTOR_DEF\n,\nVARIABLE_DEF\n,\nRECORD_DEF\n,\nCOMPACT_CTOR_DEF\n.\n"}}
