{"AvoidDoubleBraceInitialization": {"description": "Description\n\nDetects double brace initialization.\n\n\nRationale: Double brace initialization (set of\n\nInstance Initializers in class body) may look cool,\nbut it is considered as anti-pattern and should be avoided.\nThis is also can lead to a hard-to-detect memory leak, if the anonymous class instance is\nreturned outside and other object(s) hold reference to it.\nCreated anonymous class is not static, it holds an implicit reference to the outer class\ninstance.\nSee this\n\nblog post and\n\narticle for more details.\nCheck ignores any comments and semicolons in class body.", "option": ""}}
