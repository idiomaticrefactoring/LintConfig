{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks for unused import statements. An\nimport statement is considered unused if:\n\n\n\nIt is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support\nwild-card imports like import\njava.io.*;. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated checks\nfor imports that handle wild-card imports.\n\n\nThe class imported is from the java.lang\npackage. For example importing java.lang.String.\n\n\nThe class imported is from the same package.\n\n\nA static method is imported when used as method reference. In that case,\nonly the type needs to be imported and that's enough to resolve the method.\n\n\nOptionally: it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check\nis on by default, but it is considered bad practice to introduce\na compile-time dependency for documentation purposes only.\nAs an example, the import java.util.List would be\nconsidered referenced with the Javadoc comment\n{@link List}. The alternative to avoid introducing a\ncompile-time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as\n{@link java.util.List}.\n\n\n\nThe main limitation of this check is handling the cases where:\n\n\n\nAn imported type has the same name as a declaration, such as a member variable.\n\n\nThere are two or more static imports with the same method name\n(javac can distinguish imports with same name but different parameters, but checkstyle\ncan not due to\nlimitation.)", "option": "\nprocessJavadoc, Control whether to process Javadoc comments., boolean, true"}}
