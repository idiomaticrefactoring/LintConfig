{"AvoidStaticImport": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks that there are no static import statements.\n\n\nRationale: Importing static members can lead to naming\nconflicts between class' members. It may lead to poor code\nreadability since it may no longer be clear what class a\nmember resides in (without looking at the import statement).", "option": "\nexcludes, Control whether to allow for certain classes via a star notation to be excluded such as java.lang.Math.* or specific static members to be excluded like java.lang.System.out for a variable or java.lang.Math.random for a method. See notes section for details., String[], {}"}}
