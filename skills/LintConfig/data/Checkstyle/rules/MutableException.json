{"MutableException": {"description": "Description\n\nEnsures that exception classes (classes with names conforming to some pattern\nand explicitly extending classes with names conforming to other\npattern) are immutable, that is, that they have only final fields.\n\n\nThe current algorithm is very simple: it checks that all members of\nexception are final. The user can still mutate an exception's instance\n(e.g. Throwable has a method called setStackTrace\nwhich changes the exception's stack trace). But, at least, all information\nprovided by this exception type is unchangeable.\n\n\nRationale: Exception instances should represent an error\ncondition. Having non-final fields not only allows the state to be\nmodified by accident and therefore mask the original condition but\nalso allows developers to accidentally forget to set the initial state.\nIn both cases, code catching the exception could draw incorrect\nconclusions based on the state.", "option": "\nextendedClassNameFormat, Specify pattern for extended class names., Pattern, \"^.*Exception$|^.*Error$|^.*Throwable$\"\nformat, Specify pattern for exception class names., Pattern, \"^.*Exception$|^.*Error$|^.*Throwable$\""}}
