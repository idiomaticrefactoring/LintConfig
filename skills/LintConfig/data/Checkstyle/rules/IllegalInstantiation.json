{"IllegalInstantiation": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks for illegal instantiations where a factory method is\npreferred.\n\n\nRationale: Depending on the project, for some classes it might be\npreferable to create instances through factory methods rather than\ncalling the constructor.\n\n\nA simple example is the java.lang.Boolean\nclass. For performance reasons, it is preferable to\nuse the predefined constants  TRUE and\nFALSE. Constructor invocations should be\nreplaced by calls to Boolean.valueOf().\n\n\nSome extremely performance sensitive projects may require the use of\nfactory methods for other classes as well, to enforce the usage of\nnumber caches or object pools.", "option": "\nclasses, Specify fully qualified class names that should not be instantiated., String[], {}"}}
