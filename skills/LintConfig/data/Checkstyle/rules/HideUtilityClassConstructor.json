{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nMakes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static\nmethods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.\n\n\nRationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,\nthe constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow\nsubclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the\ndefault constructor.\n\n\nIf you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the\nfollowing constructor implementation technique to disallow\ninstantiating subclasses:\n\n\n\npublic class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing\n{\nprotected StringUtils() {\n// prevents calls from subclass\nthrow new UnsupportedOperationException();\n}\n\npublic static int count(char c, String s) {\n// ...\n}\n}", "option": ""}}
