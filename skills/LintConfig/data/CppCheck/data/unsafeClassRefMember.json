        "introduction": "Unsafe class checking: The const reference member 'UnsafeClass::var' is initialized by a const reference constructor argument. You need to be careful about lifetime issues. If you pass a local variable or temporary value in this constructor argument, be extra careful. If the argument is always some global object that is never destroyed then this is safe usage. However it would be defensive to make the member 'UnsafeClass::var' a non-reference variable or a smart pointer.",
