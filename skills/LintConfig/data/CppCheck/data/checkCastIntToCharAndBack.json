        "introduction": "When saving func_name() return value in char variable there is loss of precision.  When func_name() returns EOF this value is truncated. Comparing the char variable with EOF can have unexpected results. For instance a loop \"while (EOF != (c = func_name());\" loops forever on some compilers/platforms and on other compilers/platforms it will stop when the file contains a matching character.",
