        "description": "Description\n\nReassigning values to incoming parameters of a method or constructor is not recommended, as this can\nmake the code more difficult to understand. The code is often read with the assumption that parameter values\ndon’t change and an assignment violates therefore the principle of least astonishment. This is especially a\nproblem if the parameter is documented e.g. in the method’s javadoc and the new content differs from the original\ndocumented content.\n\nUse temporary local variables instead. This allows you to assign a new name, which makes the code better\nunderstandable.\n\nNote that this rule considers both methods and constructors. If there are multiple assignments for a formal\nparameter, then only the first assignment is reported.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
