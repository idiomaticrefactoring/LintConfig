        "description": "Description\n\nClasses that implementComparableshould override bothequals()andhashCode()if instances of these classes are used in collections. This is\nto ensure that the class’s natural ordering is consistent withequals().\nFailing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior in sets which then do not\nconform to theSetinterface. While theSetinterface relies onequals()to determine object equality, sorted sets likeTreeSetusecompareTo()instead. The same issue can arise when such objects are used\nas keys in sorted maps.\n\nNote 1: This rule is related toOverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode. It\nwill report missingequals()and/orhashCode()methods for classes only\nthat implementComparable.\n\nNote 2: This rule reports records only, if eitherequals()orhashCode()have been overridden, but not both. If a record uses the generated\nequals/hashCode methods, then thecompareTo()implementation is only\nconsistent withequals()if all record components are considered.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
