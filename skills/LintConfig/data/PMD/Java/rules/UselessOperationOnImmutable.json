The operation can probably be removed.\n\nThis rule recognizes the typesString,BigDecimal,BigIntegeror any type fromjava.time.*as immutable.\n\nDeprecated:This rule is deprecated since PMD 7.17.0 and will be removed with PMD 8.0.0.\nThis rule has been replaced byUselessPureMethodCall.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
