This makes the tests more robust, and using assert\nwith messages provide the developer a clearer idea of what the test does.\n\nThis rule checks for JUnit (3, 4 and 5) and TestNG Tests.\n\nNote: This rule was named JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert before PMD 7.7.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
