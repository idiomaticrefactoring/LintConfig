If the constants are best viewed as members of an enumerated type, you should export them with an enum type.\nFor other scenarios, consider using a utility class. See Effective Java’s ‘Use interfaces only to define types’.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
