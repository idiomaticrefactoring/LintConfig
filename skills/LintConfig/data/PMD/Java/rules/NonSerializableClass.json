Static fields are not considered.\n\nThis rule reports all fields, that are not serializable.\n\nIf a class implements the methods to perform manual serialization (writeObject,readObject) or uses\na replacement object (writeReplace,readResolve) then this class is ignored.\n\nNote: This rule has been revamped with PMD 6.52.0. It was previously called \"BeanMembersShouldSerialize\".\nThe propertyprefixhas been deprecated, since in a serializable class all fields have to be\nserializable regardless of the name.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
