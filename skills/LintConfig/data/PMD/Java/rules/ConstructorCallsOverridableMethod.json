These\nare invoked on an incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to debug if overridden.\nThis is because the subclass usually assumes that the superclass is completely initialized\nin all methods. If that is not the case, bugs can appear in the constructor, for instance,\nsome fields that are still null may cause a NullPointerException or be stored somewhere\nelse to blow up later.\n\nTo avoid this problem, only use methods that are static, private, or final in constructors.\nNote that those methods also must not call overridable methods transitively to be safe.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
