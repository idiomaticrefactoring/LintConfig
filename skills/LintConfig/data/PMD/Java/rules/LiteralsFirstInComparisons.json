Note that switching literal positions for compareTo and\ncompareToIgnoreCase may change the result, see examples.\n\nNote that compile-time constant strings are treated like literals. This is because they are inlined into\nthe class file, are necessarily non-null, and therefore cannot cause an NPE at runtime.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
