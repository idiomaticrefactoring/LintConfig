        "description": "Description\n\nIf an abstract class does not provide any methods, it may be acting as a simple data container\nthat is not meant to be instantiated. In this case, it is probably better to use a private or\nprotected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
