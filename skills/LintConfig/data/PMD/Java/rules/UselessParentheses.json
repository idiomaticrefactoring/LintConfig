Parentheses whose removal would not change the relative nesting of operators\nare unnecessary, because they don’t change the semantics of the enclosing expression.\n\nSome parentheses that strictly speaking are unnecessary, may still be considered useful\nfor readability. This rule allows to ignore violations on two kinds of unnecessary parentheses:\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
