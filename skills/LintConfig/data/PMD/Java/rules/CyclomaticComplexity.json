        "description": "Description\n\nThe complexity of methods directly affects maintenance costs and readability. Concentrating too much decisional logic\nin a single method makes its behaviour hard to read and change.\n\nCyclomatic complexity assesses the complexity of a method by counting the number of decision points in a method,\nplus one for the method entry. Decision points are places where the control flow jumps to another place in the\nprogram. As such, they include all control flow statements, such asif,while,for, andcase. For more\ndetails on the calculation, see the documentationCYCLO.\n\nGenerally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote\nhigh complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity. By default, this rule reports methods with a complexity >= 10.\nAdditionally, classes with many methods of moderate complexity get reported as well once the total of their\nmethods’ complexities reaches 80, even if none of the methods was directly reported.\n\nReported methods should be broken down into several smaller methods. Reported classes should probably be broken down\ninto subcomponents.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
