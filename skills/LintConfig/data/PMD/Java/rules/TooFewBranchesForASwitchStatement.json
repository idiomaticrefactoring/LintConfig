Use instead:TooFewBranchesForSwitch\n\nDeprecated\n\nSwitch statements are intended to be used to support complex branching behaviour. Using a switch for only a few\ncases is ill-advised, since switches are not as easy to understand as if-else statements. In these cases use the\nif-else statement to increase code readability.\n\nNote: This rule was named TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement before PMD 7.7.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
