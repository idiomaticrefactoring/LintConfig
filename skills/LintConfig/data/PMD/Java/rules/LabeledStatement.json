This can be changed with the propertyallowLoopsto flag any\nlabels.\n\nLabels make control flow difficult to understand and should be avoided. They can be confused\nwith the goto statement and make code harder to read and maintain.\n\nIf you really need to jump out of an inner loop, think about refactoring the multiple\nloops into a function - that way, you can replace the break with a return.\n\nThis rule implements SonarSource ruleS1119.\n\nTo detect unused labels, use the ruleUnusedLabel.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
