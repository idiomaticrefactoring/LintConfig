To test whether a\nvalue is the NaN value, one should instead useDouble.isNaN(someDouble)(orFloat.isNaN). The!=operator should be treated similarly.\nFinally, comparisons likesomeDouble <= Double.NaNare nonsensical\nand will always evaluate to false.\n\nThis rule has been renamed from \"BadComparison\" in PMD 6.36.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
