Having a non-test class with that name\nis not a good practice, since most people will assume it is a test case. Test classes have test methods\nnamed \"testXXX\" (JUnit3) or use annotations (e.g.@Test).\n\nThe regular expression to match can be configured using the propertytestClassPattern. To disable the detection of\npossible test classes by name, set this property to an empty string.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
