This adds overhead, and to the dex method count on Android. This situation can\nbe avoided by changing the visibility of the field / method from private to package-private.\n\nNote:This rule is only executed for Java 10 or lower.\nSince Java 11,JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Controlhas been implemented. This\nmeans that in Java 11 and above accessor classes are not generated anymore.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
