        "description": "Description\n\nData Classes are simple data holders, which reveal most of their state, and\nwithout complex functionality. The lack of functionality may indicate that\ntheir behaviour is defined elsewhere, which is a sign of poor data-behaviour\nproximity. By directly exposing their internals, Data Classes break encapsulation,\nand therefore reduce the system’s maintainability and understandability. Moreover,\nclasses tend to strongly rely on their data representation, which makes for a brittle\ndesign.\n\nRefactoring a Data Class should focus on restoring a good data-behaviour proximity. In\nmost cases, that means moving the operations defined on the data back into the class.\nIn some other cases it may make sense to remove entirely the class and move the data\ninto the former client classes.\n\nThe rule uses metrics to implement its detection strategy. The violation message\ngives information about the values of these metrics:\n\nThe rule identifies a god class by looking for classes which have all of the following properties:\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
