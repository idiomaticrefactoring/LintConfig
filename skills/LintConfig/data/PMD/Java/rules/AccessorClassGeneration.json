        "description": "Description\n\nMaximum Language Version:Java 10\n\nInstantiation by way of private constructors from outside the constructor’s class often causes the\ngeneration of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privatization of the constructor can eliminate this\nsituation. The generated class file is actually an interface.  It gives the accessing class the ability\nto invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter.\nThis turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.\n\nNote:This rule is only executed for Java 10 or lower.\nSince Java 11,JEP 181: Nest-Based Access Controlhas been implemented. This\nmeans that in Java 11 and above accessor classes are not generated anymore.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
