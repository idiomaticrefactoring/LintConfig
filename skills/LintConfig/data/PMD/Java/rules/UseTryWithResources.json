        "description": "Description\n\nMinimum Language Version:Java 1.7\n\nJava 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end\nof the statement. It avoids the need of explicitly closing the resources in a finally block. Additionally exceptions\nare better handled: If an exception occurred both in thetryblock andfinallyblock, then the exception from\nthe try block was suppressed. With thetry-with-resources statement, the exception thrown from the try-block is\npreserved.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
