Use instead:UnitTestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation\n\nDeprecated\n\nThis rule detects methods calledsetUp()that are not properly annotated as a setup method.\nThis is primarily intended to assist in upgrading from JUnit 3, where setup methods were required to be calledsetUp().\nTo a lesser extent, this may help detect omissions even under newer JUnit versions or under TestNG,\nas long as you are following this convention to name the methods.\n\nNote: This rule was named JUnit4TestShouldUseBeforeAnnotation before PMD 7.7.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
