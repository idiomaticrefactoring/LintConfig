        "description": "Description\n\nThejava.util.Arraysclass has aasList()method that should be used when you want to create a new List from\nan array of objects. It is faster than executing a loop to copy all the elements of the array one by one.\n\nNote that the result ofArrays.asList()is backed by the specified array,\nchanges in the returned list will result in the array to be modified.\nFor that reason, it is not possible to add new elements to the returned list ofArrays.asList()(UnsupportedOperationException).\nYou must usenew ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(...))if that is inconvenient for you (e.g. because of concurrent access).\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
