Even before Java 9, they can\nbe replaced with usage of the corresponding staticvalueOffactory method\n(which may be automatically inserted by the compiler since Java 1.5).\nThis has the advantage that it may reuse common instances instead of creating\na new instance each time.\n\nNote that forBoolean, the named constantsBoolean.TRUEandBoolean.FALSEare preferred instead ofBoolean.valueOf.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
