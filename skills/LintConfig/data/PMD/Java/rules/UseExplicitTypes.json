        "description": "Description\n\nMinimum Language Version:Java 10\n\nJava 10 introduced thevarkeyword. This reduces the amount of code written because java can infer the type\nfrom the initializer of the variable declaration.\n\nThis is essentially a trade-off: On the one hand, it can make code more readable by eliminating redundant\ninformation. On the other hand, it can make code less readable by eliding useful information. There is no\nblanket rule for whenvarshould be used or shouldn’t.\n\nIt may make sense to usevarwhen the type is inherently clear upon reading the statement\n(ie: assignment to either a literal value or a constructor call). Those use cases\ncan be enabled through properties.\n\nNotice that lambda parameters are allowed, as they are already inferred  by default (thevarkeyword\nis completely optional).\n\nSee alsoLocal Variable Type Inference Style Guidelines.\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
