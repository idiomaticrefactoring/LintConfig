Consider breaking the test scenario into multiple, shorter test scenarios.\nCustomize the maximum number of assertions used by this Rule to suit your needs.\n\nThis rule checks for JUnit (3, 4 and 5) and TestNG Tests.\n\nNote: This rule was named JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts before PMD 7.7.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
