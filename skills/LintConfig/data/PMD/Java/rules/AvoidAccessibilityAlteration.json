These can be made accessible by callingsetAccessible(true).\nThis gives access to normally protected data which violates the principle of encapsulation.\n\nThis rule detects calls tosetAccessibleand finds possible accessibility alterations.\nIf the call tosetAccessibleis wrapped within aPrivilegedAction, then the access alteration\nis assumed to be deliberate and is not reported.\n\nNote that with Java 17 the Security Manager, which is used forPrivilegedActionexecution,\nis deprecated:JEP 411: Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal.\nFor future-proof code, deliberate access alteration should be suppressed using the usual\nsuppression methods (e.g. by using@SuppressWarningsannotation).\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
