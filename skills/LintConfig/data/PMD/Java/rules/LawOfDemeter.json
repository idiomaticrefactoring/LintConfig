        "description": "Description\n\nThe law of Demeter is a simple rule that says \"only talk to friends\". It forbids\nfetching data from \"too far away\", for some definition of distance, in order to\nreduce coupling between classes or objects of different levels of abstraction.\n\nThe rule uses a notion of \"degree\", that quantifies how \"far\" an object is.\nExpressions with too high degree can only be used in certain ways. The degree of\nan expression is defined inductively:\n\nIntuitively, the more you call getters, the more the degree increases. Eventually\nthe degree reaches the report threshold (propertytrustRadius) and the expression\nis reported. The details of the calculation are more involved and make room for common\npatterns, like usage of collections (objects that are in a list or array have the\nsame degree as their container), the builder pattern, and getters that do not appear\nto break a boundary of abstraction.\n\nBe aware that this rule is prone to many false-positives and low-priority warnings.\nYou can increase thetrustRadiusproperty to reduce them drastically. The defaulttrustRadiusof 1 corresponds to the original law of Demeter (you’re only allowed\none getter call on untrusted values). Given sometrustRadiusvalue:\n\nSee also the references:\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
