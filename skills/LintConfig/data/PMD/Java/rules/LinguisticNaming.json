        "description": "Description\n\nThis rule finds Linguistic Naming Antipatterns. It checks for fields, that are named, as if they should\nbe boolean but have a different type. It also checks for methods, that according to their name, should\nreturn a boolean, but don’t. Further, it checks, that getters return something and setters won’t.\nFinally, it checks that methods, that start with \"to\" - so called transform methods - actually return\nsomething, since according to their name, they should convert or transform one object into another.\nThere is additionally an option, to check for methods that contain \"To\" in their name - which are\nalso transform methods. However, this is disabled by default, since this detection is prone to\nfalse positives.\n\nFor more information, seeLinguistic Antipatterns - What They Are and How\nDevelopers Perceive Them.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
