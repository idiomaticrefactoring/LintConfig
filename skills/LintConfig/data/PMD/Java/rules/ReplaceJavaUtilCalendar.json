It has confusing month indexing\n(January = 0), inconsistent field semantics, and verbose usage patterns. The modernjava.time API(introduced in Java 8) provides immutable, thread-safe alternatives with clear, intuitive methods.\n\nUseLocalDate(for date-only operations),LocalDateTime(for date and time), orZonedDateTime(when timezone is important) fromjava.timepackage instead.\n\nNote: Since JPA 3.2 (Jakarta Persistence) usage ofjava.util.Dateandjava.util.Calendarand others is\ndeprecated there as well in favour ofjava.timeAPI.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
