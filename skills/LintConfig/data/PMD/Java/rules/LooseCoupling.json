Whenever available, declare variables\nand parameters using a more general type (e.g,Set).\n\nThis rule reports uses of concrete collection types. User-defined types that should be treated\nthe same as interfaces can be configured with the propertyallowedTypes.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
