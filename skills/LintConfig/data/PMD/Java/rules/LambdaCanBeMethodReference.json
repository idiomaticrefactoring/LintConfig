        "description": "Description\n\nThis rule reports lambda expressions that can be written more succinctly as a method reference. This is the case if the lambda is an expression lambda that only calls one method, passing the entire lambda parameter list in order to the method. For instance:\n\nIn some cases rewriting a lambda to a method reference can change the semantics of the code. For instance in(x) -> someVar.call(x), the invocation of the lambda may produce a NullPointerException (NPE) ifsomeVaris null. The method referencesomeVar::callwill also NPE ifsomeVaris null, but it will do so at the point the method reference is created, while the lambda is created without error and its NPE is only thrown if the lambda is invoked (which may be never). Code should probably not rely on this subtle semantic difference, therefore these potentially problematic lambdas are also reported by default. This behavior can be disabled by setting the propertyignoreIfMayNPEtotrue.\n\nThe propertyignoreIfMayNPEis true by default. By default, calls whose receiver is itself a method call are ignored, because they could cause side effects. This may be changed by setting the propertyignoreIfReceiverIsMethodtofalse.\n\nScope limitations:\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
