        "description": "Description\n\nA for-in loop in which the variable name is not explicitly scoped to the enclosing scope with the ‘var’ keyword can\nrefer to a variable in an enclosing scope outside the nearest enclosing scope.  This will overwrite the\nexisting value of the variable in the outer scope when the body of the for-in is evaluated.  When the for-in loop\nhas finished, the variable will contain the last value used in the for-in, and the original value from before\nthe for-in loop will be gone.  Since the for-in variable name is most likely intended to be a temporary name, it\nis better to explicitly scope the variable name to the nearest enclosing scope with ‘var’.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
