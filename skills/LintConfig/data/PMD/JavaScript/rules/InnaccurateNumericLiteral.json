Use instead:InaccurateNumericLiteral\n\nDeprecated\n\nThe numeric literal will have a different value at runtime, which can happen if you provide too much\nprecision in a floating point number.  This may result in numeric calculations being in error.\n\nNumbersin JavaScript\nare represented by 64bit double-precision floating point numbers internally and that’s why there are some limits\nto the available precision of the number.\nSeeNumber.isSafeInteger()andNumber.EPSILON.\n\nNote: This rule was named InnaccurateNumericLiteral before PMD 7.4.0.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
