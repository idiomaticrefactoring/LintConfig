The decision points include ‘if’, ‘while’, ‘for’, and ‘case labels’ calls.\nGenerally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote\nhigh complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule with the default properties by just referencing it:\n\nUse this rule and customize it:",
