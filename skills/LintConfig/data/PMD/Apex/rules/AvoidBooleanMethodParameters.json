They often indicate that a method is doing more than one thing and\ncould benefit from being split into separate methods with more descriptive\nnames.\n\nThis rule flags any boolean parameters found in public or global methods,\nencouraging developers to use more expressive alternatives such as enums,\nseparate methods, or configuration objects.\n\nExample(s):\n\nUse this rule by referencing it:",
