4.5.1 Where to breakThe prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level. Also:	1	When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript.)	◦	This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:	◦	the dot separator (.)	◦	the two colons of a method reference (::)	◦	an ampersand in a type bound (<T extends Foo & Bar>)	◦	a pipe in a catch block (catch (FooException | BarException e)).
