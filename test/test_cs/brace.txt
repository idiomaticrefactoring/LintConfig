"4.1.1 Use of optional braces            
                                                                                                                                                                       
    Braces are used with if, else, for, do and while statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                       
    Other optional braces, such as those in a lambda expression, remain optional."
