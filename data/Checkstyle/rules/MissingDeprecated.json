{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nVerifies that the annotation @Deprecated and the Javadoc tag\n@deprecated are both present when either of them is present.\n\n\nBoth ways of flagging deprecation serve their own purpose.\nThe @Deprecated annotation is used for compilers and development tools.\nThe @deprecated javadoc tag is used to document why something is deprecated\nand what, if any, alternatives exist.\n\n\nIn order to properly mark something as deprecated both forms of\ndeprecation should be present.\n\n\nPackage deprecation is an exception to the rule of always using the\njavadoc tag and annotation to deprecate.  It is not clear if the\njavadoc tool will support it or not as newer versions keep flip-flopping\non if it is supported or will cause an error.\nSee\nJDK-8160601.\nThe deprecated javadoc tag is currently the only way to say why the package\nis deprecated and what to use instead.  Until this is resolved, if you\ndon't want to print violations on package-info, you can use a\nfilter to ignore these files until\nthe javadoc tool faithfully supports it. An example config using\nSuppressionSingleFilter is:\n\n\n\n<!-- required till https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8160601 -->\n<module name=\"SuppressionSingleFilter\">\n<property name=\"checks\" value=\"MissingDeprecatedCheck\"/>\n<property name=\"files\" value=\"package-info\\.java\"/>\n</module>", "option": "\nviolateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at\nTight-HTML Rules., boolean, false"}}
