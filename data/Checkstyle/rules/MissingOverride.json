{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nVerifies that the @Override annotation is present\nwhen the @inheritDoc javadoc tag is present.\n\n\nRationale: The @Override annotation helps\ncompiler tools ensure that an override is actually occurring.  It is\nquite easy to accidentally overload a method or hide a static method\nand using the @Override annotation points out these problems.\n\n\nThis check will log a violation if using the @inheritDoc tag on a method that\nis not valid (ex: private, or static method).\n\n\nThere is a slight difference between the @Override annotation in Java 5 versus\nJava 6 and above. In Java 5, any method overridden from an interface cannot\nbe annotated with @Override. In Java 6 this behavior is allowed.\n\n\nAs a result of the aforementioned difference between Java 5 and Java 6, a\nproperty called javaFiveCompatibility is available. This\nproperty will only check classes, interfaces, etc. that do not contain the\nextends or implements keyword or are not anonymous classes. This means it\nonly checks methods overridden from java.lang.Object.\nJava 5 Compatibility mode severely limits this check. It is recommended to\nonly use it on Java 5 source.", "option": "\njavaFiveCompatibility, Enable java 5 compatibility mode., boolean, false"}}
