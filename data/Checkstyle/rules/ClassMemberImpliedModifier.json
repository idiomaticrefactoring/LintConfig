{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks for implicit modifiers on nested types in classes and records.\n\n\nThis check is effectively the opposite of\nRedundantModifier.\nIt checks the modifiers on nested types in classes and records, ensuring that certain\nmodifiers are explicitly specified even though they are actually redundant.\n\n\nNested enums, interfaces, and records within a class are always static and as\nsuch the compiler does not require the static modifier. This check provides\nthe ability to enforce that the static modifier is explicitly coded and not\nimplicitly added by the compiler.\n\n\n\npublic final class Person {\nenum Age {  // violation\nCHILD, ADULT\n}\n}\n\n\nRationale for this check:\nNested enums, interfaces, and records are treated differently from nested classes as they\nare only allowed to be static. Developers should not need to remember this\nrule, and this check provides the means to enforce that the modifier is coded explicitly.", "option": "\nviolateImpliedStaticOnNestedEnum, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested enums in classes and records., boolean, true\nviolateImpliedStaticOnNestedInterface, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested interfaces in classes and records., boolean, true\nviolateImpliedStaticOnNestedRecord, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested records in classes and records., boolean, true"}}
