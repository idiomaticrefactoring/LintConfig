{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks that array initialization contains a trailing comma.\n\n\n\nint[] a = new int[]\n{\n1,\n2,\n3,\n};\n\n\nBy default, the check demands a comma at the end if neither left nor right curly braces\nare on the same line as the last element of the array.\n\n\n\nreturn new int[] { 0 };\nreturn new int[] { 0\n};\nreturn new int[] {\n0 };\n\n\nRationale: Putting this comma in makes it easier to change the order\nof the elements or add new elements on the end. Main benefit of a trailing\ncomma is that when you add new entry to an array, no surrounding lines are changed.\n\n\n\n{\n100000000000000000000,\n200000000000000000000, // OK\n}\n\n{\n100000000000000000000,\n200000000000000000000,\n300000000000000000000,  // Just this line added, no other changes\n}\n\n\nIf closing brace is on the same line as trailing comma, this benefit is gone\n(as the check does not demand a certain location of curly braces the following\ntwo cases will not produce a violation):\n\n\n\n{100000000000000000000,\n200000000000000000000,} // Trailing comma not needed, line needs to be modified anyway\n\n{100000000000000000000,\n200000000000000000000, // Modified line\n300000000000000000000,} // Added line\n\n\nIf opening brace is on the same line as trailing comma there's also (more arguable)\nproblem:\n\n\n\n{100000000000000000000, // Line cannot be just duplicated to slightly modify entry\n}\n\n{100000000000000000000,\n100000000000000000001, // More work needed to duplicate\n}", "option": "\nalwaysDemandTrailingComma, Control whether to always check for a trailing comma, even when an array is inline., boolean, false"}}
