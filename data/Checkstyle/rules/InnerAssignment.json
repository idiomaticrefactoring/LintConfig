{"rule_name": {"description": "Description\n\nChecks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in\nString s = Integer.toString(i = 2);.\n\n\nRationale: Except for the loop idioms,\nall assignments should occur in their own top-level statement\nto increase readability. With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult\nto see all places where a variable is set.\n\n\nNote: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:\n\n\n\nString line;\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK\n// process the line\n}\n\nfor (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK\n// process the line\n}\n\ndo {\n// process the line\n}\nwhile ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK\n\n\nAssignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded by\nan extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is != null and there is no\nchance that intention was to write line == reader.readLine().", "option": ""}}
